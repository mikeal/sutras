Chapter Three of the Section on Mindfulness of the Body

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，或作安隱或不安隱？彼以聞慧或以天眼見乾糞風：若我多食，風則不調，能令苦惱，入於身分筋脈之中，令糞乾燥，或二日、三日、四日、五日，乃一便利乾燥少穢而甚苦痛。若風調順，則無此病。觀乾糞風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see the dry feces wind: If I overeat, the wind becomes unbalanced, causing suffering and distress, entering into the body's parts, muscles, and veins, making the feces dry, resulting in hard bowel movements maybe every two, three, four, or five days, causing severe pain due to the scant and dried feces. If the wind is well-regulated, then this ailment does not occur. Having observed the dry feces wind, one truly understands the body."

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，或為安隱或不安隱？彼以聞慧或以天眼見兩傍風若不調順，為何所作？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：兩傍風行於身側，血則乾燥，以血乾燥，受大痛苦。若風調順，則無此病。觀兩傍風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? What happens if the wind along both sides is not well-regulated? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: when the wind flows along the sides of the body and is not regulated, the blood dries up. Because the blood dries up, one experiences great pain. If the wind is well-regulated, then this ailment does not occur. Having observed the wind along both sides, one truly understands the body."

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，或作安隱或不安隱？彼以聞慧或以天眼觀何等風住我身中，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼觀見：有風名塞九孔，住在身中，若不調適，能令九孔閉塞不通——頭有七孔及大小便——九孔既塞，身則病苦，入息出息不得安隱。若風調順，令身安隱，乃能行法，以風持故，身得去來。觀九孔風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe which winds reside within my body and what actions they perform. With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: there is a wind known as the 'wind that blocks the nine orifices', residing within the body. If not regulated properly, it can cause the nine orifices to be blocked and not open — including the seven orifices on the head and the orifices for urination and defecation — once the nine orifices are blocked, the body suffers from illnesses, and inhaling and exhaling cannot be done comfortably. If the wind is well-regulated, it brings comfort to the body, allowing one to practice the Dharma, because the wind aids in the movement, the body can come and go. Having observed the wind of the nine orifices, one truly understands the body."


「復次，修行者內身循身觀。彼以聞慧或以天眼見何等風住我身中，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見有一風名斷身分，若不調順，為何所作？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：斷身分風若不調不順，手指則𤼣，不得造作，手足皆𤼣，髀筋急痛，九麁筋脈弦弦而急，身分搖動，疲極無力。斷身分風若調順者，則無如是所說諸病。觀斷身分風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see a wind called 'Breaking the Physical Elements', if not well-regulated, what does it do? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe: if the 'Breaking the Physical Elements' wind is not regulated, fingers become cramped, unable to perform actions, both hands and feet cramp, the tendons in the thighs experience acute pain, the nine major tendons and veins stiffen and tighten, causing the body parts to tremble, leading to extreme fatigue and weakness. If the wind of Breaking the Physical Elements is well-regulated, then such illnesses do not occur. Having observed the wind of Breaking the Physical Elements, one truly understands the body."


「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，或作安隱或不安隱？彼以聞慧或以天眼見內有風，名曰害火，住在身中，為何所作？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：此風力能除火熱，令食不消，不消食故，不復憶食，不能食故，則無顏色。何故無色？血乾燥故。以血乾燥，肉則消盡，肉消盡故，筋則卷縮，不復生脂，不生脂故，骨亦乾燥，骨乾燥故，髓亦乾燥，髓乾燥故，遍身精盡。心中氣力，風吹故動。若害火風調順安隱，則無如上所說病苦。觀害火風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe the wind named 'Harming Fire', residing within the body, and its actions. With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: This wind has the power to remove heat, causing indigestion; because of indigestion, there is no appetite, and without the ability to eat, there is no complexion. Why is there no complexion? Because the blood dries up. With the blood dried up, the flesh wastes away; as the flesh wastes away, the sinews contract, no longer producing fat; without fat, the bones also dry out; with the bones dried, the marrow also dries; because of the dried marrow, the body's vitality is exhausted. The energy in the heart moves because the wind blows. If the Harming Fire wind is regulated and peaceful, then there are no such diseases as mentioned above. Having observed the Harming Fire wind, one truly understands the body."

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見有風名作一切身分冷風，為何所作？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：一切身分冷風令身臭汗堅澁惡色，身體皺減，羸瘦毛竪，身生黑瘡，膿出爛臭，搔爴汁流，或生赤瘡或大蒸熱；或生白瘡，遍身麁大；或復其身如白象皮，麁澁生瘡；或復口齒希踈黧黑，手足生瘡，猶如工師，疲極頓乏，身生瘡癬，手足常熱，堅䩕麁惡；或生瘡爛，爪甲惡色，鼻柱萎倒，眼𥇒墮落；人所惡賤，一切施主之所惡見；眾蠅封著，爪甲墮落；若睡眠時，氣息惽濁，鼾睡大聲，不欲飲食或食不消，舌不得味。如是一切身分冷風令身爛壞。若一切身分冷風調順，則顏色可愛，細軟滑澤，眾人所敬，暖汗津液出於毛孔，則無如上所說諸病。觀一切身分冷風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see a wind called 'All Body Parts Cold Wind,' what does it do? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe: 'All Body Parts Cold Wind' causes the body to exude a foul-smelling sweat, making the skin rough and discolored, the body shrinks, becomes emaciated, hair stands on end, black sores appear on the body, pus oozes out emitting a foul odor, scratching results in a flow of serous fluid, and either erysipelas or severe fevers occur; or white sores appear, causing the body to become rough and enlarged; or the body resembles elephant skin, rough and generating sores; or the mouth and teeth become sparse and black, sores develop on the hands and feet resembling artisan's work, extreme fatigue ensues, sores and scabies form on the body, hands, and feet are constantly warm, hard, rough, and unpleasant; or sores fester, nails discolor, the nasal septum collapses, eyesight fails; considered despicable by others, repulsive to all benefactors; flies swarm, nails fall off; during sleep, the breath is foul and turbid, snoring loudly, unwilling to eat or drink, or if eating, digestion fails, taste is not perceived. Such 'All Body Parts Cold Wind' leads the body to rot. If 'All Body Parts Cold Wind' is regulated, then the complexion is lovable, skin is soft, smooth, and lustrous, respected by people, warm sweat and saliva exude through the pores, and such aforementioned diseases do not occur. Having observed the 'All Body Parts Cold Wind,' one truly understands the body."

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，或調不調，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：有一風名破強健，住我身中，若不調順，令心怯怖，一切身分皆悉苦痛，或身挺直，頻申不樂，出息入息悉不安隱，身體振掉，不能衣服，苦患頭痛；若習禪觀，不得一心；或見惡夢，心悶歐吐；於好色中，生顛倒見，近見為遠，焦渴憔悴。若破健風調順和適，則無如上所說諸病。觀破健風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: there is a wind called 'Breaking Strength', residing within my body. If it is not well-regulated, it leads to timidity in the heart, pain in all body parts, or causes the body to stiffen uncomfortably, making in-breaths and out-breaths not peaceful, shaking the body, incapacitating one from clothing themselves, causing severe headaches; if one practices meditation, they cannot concentrate; or they see disturbing dreams, feel oppressed or nauseous; in the presence of desirable objects, they develop distorted perceptions, perceive near objects as far, experience burning thirst and emaciation. If the 'Breaking Strength' wind is well-regulated, then none of these diseases occur. Having observed the 'Breaking Strength' wind, one truly understands the body."

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見身瞤風住我身中，或調不調，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：身瞤風若不調適，耳中鳴喚，臂肉瞤動，一切身分皆亦瞤動，處處逃走，不樂一處，更無餘病。若一切身瞤風調順，則無如上所說諸病。觀一切身瞤動風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see the wind of bodily flutter within my body, whether it is regulated or not, what actions does it perform? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: if the wind of body flutter is not well-regulated, there is ringing in the ears, the flesh of the arms flutters, all parts of the body likewise flutter, constantly moving from place to place, not comfortable in any one place, with no other sickness present. If the wind of body flutter is well-regulated, then there is none of the aforementioned sickness. Having observed the wind of body flutter, one truly understands the body.

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中？彼以聞慧或以天眼見有熱風住我身中，或調不調，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：此熱風若不調順，所食入口，咽之則燒，以是因緣，四大不調，不得增長；或所食味不作二流，濁穢不淨。若有淨流，四大增長，唯有濁穢，則為病苦。若熱風不調，所食皆濁，不作清淨，是故得病。若熱風調順，若清、若濁二種食流四大平等，以平等故，則不為病。觀熱風已，如實知身。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, causing comfort or discomfort? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: there is a wind named 'Hot Wind' residing within my body, whether well-regulated or not, what actions does it perform? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe: if this 'Hot Wind' is not well-regulated, whatever is eaten, upon swallowing burns, due to this cause, the four elements become unbalanced and do not grow; either the taste of food does not separate into its two aspects, impure and unclean. If there is a pure flow, the four elements grow, only impurity exists, then it becomes illness. If the 'Hot Wind' is unregulated, all consumed food is turbid, not clean, therefore illness arises. If the 'Hot Wind' is well-regulated, whether clear or turbid, the two kinds of food flow make the four elements equal, because of this equality, it does not become illness. Having observed the 'Hot Wind', one truly understands the body."

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見：有一風名曰集蟲，此集蟲風遍身分中，能集能散，閉塞上下。從頂至足有十種蟲：一名頭行蟲；二名骨行蟲；三名食髮蟲；四名耳行蟲；五名鼻內蟲；六名脂內行蟲；七名節行蟲；八名食涎蟲；九名食齒根蟲；十名歐吐蟲。
"Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body and what actions do they perform? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see there is a wind named 'Gathering Worms,' this wind of Gathering Worms pervades all parts of the body, capable of gathering and dispersing, obstructing the flow in both upward and downward directions. From the top of the head to the feet, there are ten types of worms: The first is called the 'Head-Walking Worm'; the second, the 'Bone-Walking Worm'; the third, the 'Hair-Eating Worm'; the fourth, the 'Ear-Walking Worm'; the fifth, the 'Inside-the-Nose Worm'; the sixth, the 'Fat-Path Worm'; the seventh, the 'Joint-Walking Worm'; the eighth, the 'Saliva-Eating Worm'; the ninth, the 'Root-of-the-Tooth-Eating Worm'; the tenth, the 'Vomiting Worm'."

Such worms move throughout all bodily components, performing actions in all realms, wherever they move, they commit transgressions. This Gathering Worms wind moves through the entire body willingly, such is the condition of the winds, through which worms spread. Having observed the Gathering Worms wind, one truly understands the body.

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風住我身中，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼觀見有風名曰上下，住在身中，或安不安，為何所作？彼以聞慧或以天眼見上下風若不調適，行於五處，作何等業？作出入氣。人說為命，行於心頂，遍於身中，自在無礙，是為風力第一分也。若風不調，能破壞身。是風亦令口中多唾，令身羸瘦，飲食反胃，逆歐而出，是為風力第二分也。住於心胸，為何所作？若氣在心，或憂或喜。若氣從咽喉上至於頂，下入舌根，隨其所念，則能有語，能說文字，思惟諸義，是為風力第三分也。復有常為身火惱亂，令身流汗，是為風力第四分也。是風遍身，瞼眼視眴動一切身，思惟遍身。依男女根能生子息，若男女行欲，如此風力，能集精血，能令女人髖骨多力，男女精血和合共集鉀羅婆身。薄精之時，風吹令厚，而作肉團；作肉摶已，次生五胞；生五胞已，或方或圓，隨身長短，識亦遍滿，隨種種相。譬如有人攢酪出酥，有酪有水、有瓮有攢，攢之出沫，知其已熟，收取生酥。如是風力及業煩惱，能集成身，亦復如是，是為第五風力分也。若飲食噉味於舌根中、咽喉脈中，飲食充滿，乃至遍於毛根爪甲，氣力增長，作色香味。若風不調，下風上行，作四種惡，氣塞難出，遍身苦惱。若離本處，一切諸根、一切識中皆得惱亂，喪失身命，既捨身已，失三種法：一、命；二、煖；三、識。是故偈言：
Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body and what actions do they perform? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe there is a wind called 'Up-Down,' residing within the body, whether at ease or not, what does it do? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see: if the Up-Down wind is not well-regulated, it operates in five places, what actions does it perform? It performs the act of inhalation and exhalation. People call it life force; it moves atop the heart, pervading the body, free and unobstructed, this is considered the first division of wind power. If the wind is not regulated, it can destroy the body. This wind also causes excessive saliva in the mouth, making the body emaciated, food and drink regurgitate, reversing and exiting, this is considered the second division of wind power. Residing in the heart chest, what does it do? If the wind is in the heart, there may be worry or joy. If the wind from the throat goes up to the crown and then down into the root of the tongue, depending upon what is contemplated, then it can produce speech, articulate words, ponder various meanings, this is considered the third division of wind power. Furthermore, constantly causing bodily heat and agitation, making the body sweat, this is the fourth division of wind power. This wind pervades the body, eyelid movements glance around moving all parts, contemplating throughout the body. Depending on male and female elements to generate offspring, if men and women engage in desire, this wind power, can gather essence and blood, enabling women's hip bones to be more powerful, combining male and female essence and blood to collectively build Kourolabha bodies. During the thin essence period, the wind blows and makes it thick, then forms meat clumps; having formed meat clumps, next develops five membranes; having developed five membranes, they may be square or round, according to the length and shortness of the body, consciousness also fills completely, according to various aspects. Just as someone coagulates curd to extract butter, there are curds and water, jugs, and squeezing, squeezing it extrudes froth, knowing it's cooked, collects and produces butter. Thus, wind power and karmic afflictions assemble the body, also likewise, this is considered the fifth division of wind power. If drinking food and tasting at the root of the tongue, within the throat veins, food and drink are satiated, even spreading to the root of hairs and nails, increasing energy force, creating color, fragrance, taste. If the wind is not regulated, the lower wind ascends, creating four types of maladies, air blockage difficult to release, bodily suffering throughout. If it departs from its original place, all roots, all consciousnesses are disrupted, leading to loss of body and life, having abandoned the body, loses three things: one, life force; two, warmth; three, consciousness. Therefore, a verse says:

「『若捨此身時，　　失命暖及識，
更無所覺知，　　猶如瓦木石。』
"When abandoning this body, loses life, warmth, and consciousness,
No longer perceiving anything, just like tiles, wood, stones."

「是則名為第一惡也。若不調適，作第二業，喘息麁重，不能調順，一切遍身苦惱所逼，逼之苦極，則捨身命，是則名為第二惡也。是上行風若不調順，作第三惡，既惱諸根，一切遍身而作惱亂，喪失身命，是則名為第三惡也。是上行風若不調適，作第四惡，或大喘息或復微少，或致命終，或但傴身而不失命，是則名曰第四惡也。若睡眠時，氣息出入，以時命根。如是觀上下風已，如實知身。
This is then called the first evil. If not well-regulated, performs the second action, breathing is rough and heavy, unable to regulate smoothly, all over the body is forced by suffering, the suffering forces to the extreme, then abandons the body and life, this is named the second evil. If the upward moving wind is not well-regulated, performs the third evil, once disturbing the senses, creates turmoil throughout the body and leads to loss of body and life, this is named the third evil. If the upward moving wind is not well-regulated, performs the fourth evil, either great labored breathing or slightly lesser, either leading to death, or just bending the body without losing life, this is called the fourth evil. If during sleep, the breath goes in and out, timing the life root. Having observed the Up-Down wind as such, truly understands the body.

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風，或安不安，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼觀見：有風名曰命風，住在身中，或令身肥或令羸瘦，令心審諦，若風不調，心則輕動，所知皆失，曾聞亦忘失，見境不了，於聲不聞，如是鼻不知香、舌不知味、身不覺觸、意不知法，不識自他。觀命風已，如實知身。
Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, whether at ease or not, what actions do they perform? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they observe: there is wind called 'Life Wind,' residing within the body, making the body either fat or thin, making the mind precise, if the wind is not regulated, the mind then easily stirs, all known faculties are lost, previously heard also forgotten, seeing forms not clearly, not hearing sounds, thus, the nose not recognizing scent, the tongue not recognizing taste, the body not feeling touch, the mind not knowing dharmas, not recognizing self and others. Having observed the Life Wind, one truly understands the body.

「復次，修行者內身循身觀。有何等風，作何等業？彼以聞慧或以天眼見亂心風住於身中，若調不調，為何所作？彼以聞慧或以天眼見於此風：若我心過，風不調順，隨心所行，或動或頑，乾消癡亂，或所食味，邪流不正，如是惱亂其心，令於善法不生愛樂，流汗多唾，不耐冷觸；若見色相，以有病故，不能如本、如實見色，身重難攝，身毛皆竪。若風調順，則無如向所說之病。觀亂心風已，如實知身。
Furthermore, the practitioner internally observes the body in detail. What kinds of winds reside within my body, what actions do they perform? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, they see the 'Disturbed Mind Wind' residing in the body; if regulated or not, what does it do? With the wisdom derived from hearing or with the divine eye, upon viewing this wind: If my mind errs, the wind is not regulated, wherever the mind goes, either moving or dull, drying up and confusing, or the taste of food, improper flow not correct, thus disturbing the mind, making it not take joy in wholesome dharmas, sweating profusely, salivating excessively, intolerant to cold touch; if viewing forms, due to illness, unable to see colors originally, the body heavy and difficult to manage, all body hairs stand on end. If the wind is well-regulated, then none of the previously mentioned diseases occur. Having observed the 'Disturbed Mind Wind', one truly understands the body.
