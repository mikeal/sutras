分別緣起初勝法門經卷上
**Sūtra on Discerning the Supreme Teaching of the Initial Aspect of Dependent Origination** (First Scroll)

大唐三藏法師玄奘奉　詔譯
Translated by Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang of the Great Tang by Imperial Decree.

如是我聞：
Thus have I heard:

一時，薄伽梵在室羅筏住誓多林給孤獨園。時有眾多大苾芻眾，在安適堂同集會坐，作如是類往復談論言：「諸大德！世尊曾以無量異門，說十二分甚深緣起，於彼最初宣說無明，以為緣性。何因緣故，一切煩惱諸行緣中，唯說無明以為緣性？於此無明見何殊勝？」由是因緣便興諍論。
Once, the Bhagavān was in Śrāvastī, residing in Anāthapiṇḍada's park in the Jetavana grove. At that time, many great bhikṣus gathered in the Comfort Hall, engaging in the following discourse: "Great Elders! The World Honored One has, through countless approaches, expounded the profound twelve aspects of dependent origination. Initially, he proclaimed ignorance as the fundamental cause. Why, among all afflictive conditions, are formations conditioned only by ignorance? What is the unique significance of this ignorance?" This query led to a debate.

于時世尊，遊於天住，以超過人清淨天耳，聞如是事。於日晚時從宴坐起，詣安適堂，在大眾前敷如常座，結加趺坐，以清美音告諸大眾：「汝等何故集此堂中而興諍論？汝等今者，為何所論於此集會？」
At that time, the World Honored One, moving through celestial realms, overheard this discourse with his pure divine ear. In the evening, rising from his meditative seat, he proceeded to the Comfort Hall, arranged his seat as usual, and, seated in full lotus posture, addressed the assembly in a clear, beautiful voice: "Why do you gather here and engage in this debate? What are you discussing in this assembly?"

時諸大眾白言：「世尊！我等集此，作如是類往復談論言：『諸大德！世尊曾以無量異門說十二分甚深緣起，於彼最初，宣說無明以為緣性。何因緣故，一切煩惱諸行緣中，唯說無明以為緣性？於此無明見何殊勝？』世尊！我等由是因緣便興諍論，我等今者為論是事於此集會。」作是語已。
The assembly replied, "World Honored One! We have gathered here and were discussing: 'Great Elders! The World Honored One has, through countless approaches, expounded the profound twelve aspects of dependent origination. Initially, he proclaimed ignorance as the fundamental cause. Why, among all afflictive conditions, are formations conditioned only by ignorance? What is the unique significance of this ignorance?' This query led to our debate and today we discuss it in this assembly."

爾時世尊告彼大眾：「我有如是分別緣起初勝法門，汝應諦聽極善作意，當為汝說。云何名為分別緣起初勝法門？謂十一種殊勝事故，於緣起初，宣說無明以為緣性。何等十一？謂所緣殊勝、行相殊勝、因緣殊勝、等起殊勝、轉異殊勝、邪行殊勝、相狀殊勝、作業殊勝、障礙殊勝、隨縛殊勝、對治殊勝。」
At that time, the World Honored One addressed the assembly: "I possess the teaching that discerns the supreme aspect of the initial aspect of dependent origination. Listen carefully and with great attention. I shall now elucidate it for you. What is meant by discerning the supreme aspect of the initial aspect of dependent origination? It is explained through eleven distinctive reasons that proclaim ignorance as the fundamental cause. What are these eleven? They are the distinct superiority of the object, characteristic, cause, arising, transformation, misconduct, appearance, action, obstruction, bondage, and remedy.

爾時眾中有一苾芻，從座而起偏袒右肩，合掌禮佛，白言：「世尊！云何無明所緣殊勝？」
At that time, a bhikṣu in the assembly rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and, joining his palms in reverence, addressed the Buddha, "World Honored One! What is the superior object of ignorance?"

世尊告曰：「無明所緣，即是一切若因若果有眾過患諸雜染品，及以一切若因若果有眾功德諸清淨品，是名無明所緣殊勝。」
The World Honored One replied, "The object of ignorance encompasses all afflictive and contaminative aspects, whether cause or result, and also any purifying and meritorious aspects, whether cause or result. This defines the superior object of ignorance."

復言：「世尊！云何無明行相殊勝？」
Then the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is the superior characteristic of ignorance?"

世尊告曰：「如是無明隱覆真實、顯現虛妄以為行相。是名無明行相殊勝。」
The World Honored One replied, "Ignorance is characterized by concealing the truth and manifesting delusion. This defines the superior characteristic of ignorance."

復言：「世尊！云何無明因緣殊勝？」
Again the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is the superior cause of ignorance?"

世尊告曰：「如是無明，普於一切煩惱雜染、諸業雜染、諸生雜染，能作因緣根本依處。云何一切煩惱雜染？謂略有三煩惱品類，普攝一切煩惱雜染，謂無知煩惱、猶預煩惱、顛倒煩惱。云何一切諸業雜染？謂略有三自相差別（身、語、意業）及三障礙對治差別（謂福、非福及不動業），普攝一切諸業雜染。云何一切諸生雜染？謂略有三依止三受（謂樂及苦、不苦不樂）所起三苦（壞苦、苦苦及以行苦），普攝一切諸生雜染。云何無明普於一切煩惱雜染、諸業雜染、諸生雜染，能作因緣根本依處？謂於諸諦有二種愚，能令一切煩惱雜染，未生而生，生已增廣；及令一切諸業雜染，未生而生，生已積集；亦令一切諸生雜染，未生而生，生已不轉。是故我說如是無明，普於一切煩惱雜染、諸業雜染、諸生雜染，能作因緣根本依處，是名無明因緣殊勝。」
The World Honored One replied, "Ignorance functions as the root cause and foundational support for all afflictive, karmic, and existential contaminations. What are afflictive contaminations? They are generally grouped into three categories: the affliction of ignorance, the affliction of preconception, and the affliction of delusion. What are karmic contaminations? They are generally divided into three distinct types (body, speech, and mind) and three hindrances and remedies (meritorious, non-meritorious, and immovable actions), encompassing all karmic contaminations. What are existential contaminations? They are generally grouped into three types of suffering arising from three kinds of feelings (pleasant, painful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant), leading to three kinds of suffering (suffering of suffering, suffering of change, and pervasive suffering), covering all existential contaminations. How does ignorance function as the root cause and foundational support for all afflictive, karmic, and existential contaminations? It is due to two types of folly regarding the truths that generate all afflictions before their arising, increase them once they have arisen, and similarly affect karmic and existential contaminations. This is why I declare that ignorance universally serves as the root cause and foundational support for all afflictive, karmic, and existential contaminations. This defines the superior cause of ignorance."

復言：「世尊！云何無明等起殊勝？」
Again, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is the superior arising of ignorance?"

世尊告曰：「謂此無明，或愚當來苦諦所攝後有自體，或愚現法苦諦所攝已得自體，如是愚者，或有能引所引緣起，或有能生所生緣起。此二緣起，即以愚於當來現法自體無明作等起緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "Ignorance may obscure the understanding of the truth of the suffering to come, or ignorance may obscure the understanding of the truth of suffering already present. Thus, those with this kind of ignorance may either mislead or be misled by others in the process of dependent origination. This two-fold arising refers to both obscuring one's own and others' understanding of the suffering to come and the present suffering."

復言：「世尊！云何能引所引緣起？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is meant by misleading and being misled in the process of dependent origination?"

世尊告曰：「第一無明緣行，行緣識，識緣名色，名色緣六處，六處緣觸，觸緣受，是名能引所引緣起。」
The World Honored One replied, "First, ignorance conditions formations, formations condition consciousness, consciousness conditions name-and-form, name-and-form condition the six sense bases, the six sense bases condition contact, and contact conditions feeling. This is described as misleading and being misled in the process of dependent origination."

復言：「世尊！云何能生所生緣起？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is meant by causing and being caused by the process of dependent origination?"

世尊告曰：「第二無明緣受，受緣愛，愛緣取，取緣有，有緣生，生緣老死，是名能生所生緣起。」
The World Honored One replied, "Second, ignorance conditions feeling, feeling conditions craving, craving conditions clinging, clinging conditions becoming, becoming conditions birth, and birth conditions aging and death. This is described as causing and being caused by the process of dependent origination."

復言：「世尊！云何名為第一無明與其能引所引緣起作等起緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is meant by the first ignorance serving as the root cause of misleading and being misled in the process of dependent origination?"

世尊告曰：「謂有一類，愚於當來後有自體，即便發起後有希求。由愚所生後有希求，便於後有見勝功德。若於現法執著可愛、不可愛境，邪分別故，造非福行。彼於資具生貪著故，或於怨憎生瞋恚故，及彼相應不能決了功德過患，放逸愚故，造斯惡行。即於後世所有過失不能思惟，不能解了行相，無明能作如是非福行緣。若於後有見勝功德，或見出離，便造福行或不動行。彼依教法或依誨法，發起思擇及修習故，能造斯行。應知如是思擇修習雖在善心，然不如理作意思惟，故是後有愚癡所引，謂於後有見勝功德，癡覆藏故，及見出離，癡覆藏故。如是非福、福、不動行，障礙對治，與六識身俱生俱滅，能於現在已得生滅異熟識中安置諸行。三種習氣由此方便，攝受後有新生種子。攝受後有新種子故，於當生中所起後有所攝名色、六處、觸、受次第而生。此名色等，於現已得異熟識中，但起因性未有果性，是故但名所引緣起。如是名為第一無明與其能引所引緣起作等起緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "There is a type of ignorance that, when present, leads to a desire for future existence. Due to this desire, one sees future existence as possessing supreme merits. With attachment to present pleasant and unpleasant states, through incorrect views, one performs non-meritorious actions. Due to attachment to material possessions and anger towards enemies, combined with lack of discernment regarding merit and demerit, one performs such non-meritorious actions. In this way, ignorance serves as the condition for non-meritorious actions."

復言：「世尊！云何名為第二無明與其能生所生緣起作等起緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What is meant by the second ignorance serving as the root cause of causing and being caused by the process of dependent origination?"

世尊告曰：「謂有一類，愚於現在已得自體，於六觸處為緣生受，便起味著。由味著故，希求當來如是類受。由希求故，於追求時便起於取，樂受所起愛為緣故，發生欲取。言欲取者，謂於諸欲妄分別貪。此為上首，此為前行，便有欲界一切煩惱。若復以其苦受為緣，生無有愛，厭離俱行非理所引，厭離相應，依止此愛，不正方便求無有時，即便發起出離惡見、定期惡見，及此二種所依惡見。由此義故，名愛緣取。若即以此取為所依，不離欲貪而命終者，由此諸見及與欲界一切煩惱，名有欲界愛為緣取。若離欲貪，或離色貪，彼色界愛或無色愛便得生處。彼於色界或無色界煩惱轉時，發起色界、無色界取，由此諸色、無色煩惱及彼諸見，名有色界愛為緣取，及無色界愛為緣取。彼由如是愛為緣取，先得種種行所熏習異熟果識，名為有取。彼由如是取所攝受，先所積集行等種子，若彼彼處諸愛未斷，即彼彼處功能現前，能生後有。由彼行等能有當生，能令生有將入現在，故說名有。由彼取力，行等成有。以是為緣，從此命終，先所引發漸次生起，由此義故，名有緣生。生既生已，先起時分變異名老，於最後邊命盡名死，由是故名生緣老死。如是名為第二無明與其能生所生緣起為等起緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "There is a type of ignorance that, when present, leads to attachment to present pleasant and unpleasant states. Due to this attachment, one desires similar states in the future. This desire leads to clinging, which, through pleasant feelings, gives rise to craving. Craving here refers to a false, attachment-laden differentiation towards various desires. This leads to craving for sensual pleasures and non-existence, encompassing all the afflictions of the desire realm. If, due to feelings of suffering, one develops aversion, associated with non-attachment and incorrect endeavors, one falls into erroneous views of liberation determined by fixed periods. This is why craving conditions clinging."

復言：「世尊！何緣不說愛取二種能生緣起與行為緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Why do we not say craving and clinging, as two types, condition formations?"

世尊告曰：「愛取二種自界所行有分齊故。所以者何？欲界愛取，與彼色界或無色界諸不動行為等起緣，不應道理，非境界故。如說欲界愛取二種於不動行，如是色界愛取二種於無色界諸不動行，若無色界愛取二種於欲界行或色界行，及以色界愛取二種於欲界行，當知亦爾。」
The World Honored One replied, "Due to desire and clinging being confined to their own realms. Why? Craving and clinging of the desire realm cannot condition formations of the form or formless realm due to differences in domains and conditions. Thus, craving and clinging associated with the desire realm cannot function as the condition for formations of the form or formless realm."

復言：「世尊！何緣欲界愛取二種，不與非福、福行為緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Why do we not say craving and clinging, as two types, condition non-meritorious and meritorious formations?"

世尊告曰：「諸有現前愛非愛境增上力故，發生欲愛起不善根造非福行，一切皆由於因於果非福行中不知過患。彼由意樂有過失故，或由加行有過失故，起非福行。如是意樂、加行過失，唯用無明以為勝緣，非境界愛及不善根。若由欲愛造諸福行，彼信為依乃造斯行，於死於生起定信故。此愛及取，由信攝伏，我施設為有覆無記。若法欲界有覆無記，於發諸行無勝功能，以於因果及福行中不知出離，求可愛生造斯福行故，此福行亦唯無明以為勝緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "Due to the dominance of craving for pleasant and unpleasant states in the desire realm, leading to the arising of non-meritorious actions from unwholesome roots. This is because of ignorance regarding the faults of non-meritorious actions. These faults in volitional intention or exertion lead to non-meritorious actions, predominantly influenced by ignorance, not by craving or unwholesome roots."

復言：「世尊！何緣色界愛取二種不作色界不動行緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Why does clinging and craving, as two types, not condition formations of the form and formless realms?"

世尊告曰：「諸有未離欲界貪者，色界愛等未得生處。若無生處則無堪能，故非色界不動行緣。如說色界愛取二種於其色界諸不動行；如是無色愛取二種於無色界諸不動行，應知亦爾。彼於色界或無色界，有過患身，起有功德作意想見，或依教法或依誨法，發起如是非理作意，能為彼界不動行緣。如是所起非理作意無明所引，如是無明由此所起非理作意及果為伴，能為彼界不動行緣。是故應知，彼不動行亦唯無明以為勝緣。復有一類，依無有愛造諸福行或不動行，彼由如是無有愛故，既於諸有見多過患，豈更悕求當來諸有？然於無有不如實知，由無知故，不得諸有真對治道。又無知故，於非對治起對治想，造諸福行或不動行。由是道理，如是諸行應知唯用無明為緣，非愛及取為諸行緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "Those who have not abandoned desire for the sensual realm do not attain the birth place of form realm craving. Without birth place, no potential exists. Thus, form realm craving does not condition unmoving actions. Similarly, understand that form realm craving does not condition form realm unmoving actions, nor do formless realm craving and clinging condition formless realm actions. Those with afflictions in the form or formless realms, due to false views of their merits, either through teachings or instructions, initiate incorrect intentions. Incorrect intentions led by ignorance, accompanied by outcomes, condition their realm's unmoving actions. Thus, one should recognize that unmoving actions are conditioned by ignorance. Furthermore, those relying on non-existence for producing meritorious or unmoving actions, seeing faults in existence, do not seek future existence. Lacking accurate knowledge of non-existence, due to ignorance, they do not attain the true remedy for existence. Therefore, they mistake non-remedies for remedies, creating meritorious or unmoving actions. Consequently, understand that such actions are conditioned by ignorance, not craving and clinging."

復言：「世尊！諸所有行，與六識身相應俱有，同生同滅，何緣故說行是識緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Why does clinging and craving, as two types, not condition formations of the form and formless realms?"

世尊告曰：「以六識身與福、非福及不動行相應俱有，同生同滅，異熟識中安置諸行熏習種子，引發餘生新異熟識。由此道理，是故宣說行是識緣。」復言：「世尊！何緣名色、六處、觸、受諸分種子，異熟識中同時引發，而復說有先後次第？」
The World Honored One replied, "Due to the six consciousnesses being born and perishing alongside meritorious, non-meritorious, and unmoving actions, these actions leave imprints in the resultant consciousness, conditioning future consciousness. Thus, the actions condition consciousness." Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Since name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, and feeling arise simultaneously as seeds in resultant consciousness, why is there talk of sequence?"

世尊告曰：「彼於當來，先後次第而生起故，如是而說。」
The World Honored One replied, "They arise sequentially in future rebirths, hence described as such."

復言：「世尊！何緣名色、六處、觸、受，說為當來生身之相？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Why are name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, and feeling described as characteristics of future rebirth bodies?"

世尊告曰：「由彼是因受用依止，及是其因受用體故。」
The World Honored One replied, "Because they serve as the basis and embodiment of experiences."

復言：「世尊！若唯名生都無其色，斯有何過？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What fault would there be if only name arises without form?"

世尊告曰：「若一生中唯有其名不依色住，相續生起不應道理。」
The World Honored One replied, "If only name existed without form in a lifetime, continuous arising would be illogical."

復言：「世尊！若唯色生都無其名，斯有何過？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What fault would there be if only form arises without name?"

世尊告曰：「若唯有色無名執受，即應散壞不得增長。」
The World Honored One replied, "If only form existed without name, it would dissipate and not develop."

復言：「世尊！若但說言識緣六處，斯有何過？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What fault would there be if we only say consciousness conditions six sense bases?"

世尊告曰：「初受生時六處未滿，唯有身根及意根轉，應不可得由此兩根為體。名色最初有故，次第增長，與後圓滿六處為緣故，說名色是六處緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "At the beginning of life, the six sense bases are incomplete, with only the body and mind bases functioning. Name-and-form initially existing and then sequentially developing lead to the full six sense bases, hence name-and-form conditions the six sense bases."

復言：「世尊！若六處滿生身究竟，何緣復說觸受二種？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! If the six sense bases complete the body, why speak of contact and feeling as well?"

世尊告曰：「若於生身六處已滿，雖是受用所依究竟，而未得名受用究竟，由因及受，方得說名受用究竟。是故應知，要須受用所依究竟，及與受用因體究竟，方得說名生身究竟。」
The World Honored One replied, "Even if the six sense bases complete the body as the basis of experiences, true completion is not achieved until causes and feelings are included. Hence, the body must fully be the basis and the cause of experiences to be considered complete."

復言：「世尊！如說無明為緣生愛，又復說言受是愛緣。若唯無明是其愛緣、不緣於受，斯有何過？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! If ignorance is a condition for craving, and feeling also leads to craving, what fault would there be if only ignorance conditions craving, and not feeling?"

世尊告曰：「愛有三種，應於一時三種俱起，由愛觀待受為緣故，非一時起，由此道理，非唯無明與愛為緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "Craving is of three kinds, which should arise together. Craving depends on feeling as a condition, not arising simultaneously. Thus, craving is not conditioned by ignorance alone."

復言：「世尊！若爾，此愛唯受為緣，斯有何過？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! If craving is only conditioned by feeling, what fault would there be?"

世尊告曰：「應一切受皆是愛緣，然復有受非是愛緣，彼能為緣斷滅諸愛，是故非唯受為愛緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "If all feelings were conditions for craving, some feelings that lead to the cessation of craving would also condition craving. Thus, feeling does not solely condition craving."

復言：「世尊！若唯說愛與有作緣，不緣於取，斯有何過？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! If craving and becoming condition existence, and not clinging, what fault would there be?"

世尊告曰：「悕求名愛，於嶮惡趣無有悕求，然由所作非福行故，雖求善趣相違果生，彼果生時豈緣於愛？唯應用彼取為其緣。又如所說無有愛者，悕求無有；求無有時，由造福行、不動行故，相違果生。此果生時豈緣於愛？唯應說彼取為其緣。由此道理，非唯用愛與有為緣。」
The World Honored One replied, "Craving is pursuit. In dreadful realms, there is no pursuit. Despite seeking beneficial realms, non-meritorious deeds produce contrary results; these results should not be conditioned by craving alone but by clinging. Similarly, pursuit of non-existence through meritorious or unmoving actions produces contrary results, which should be conditioned by clinging. Thus, understanding that craving and becoming alone do not suffice as conditions."

復言：「世尊！若取緣有，有緣生者，何緣不說取之與有以為集諦？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! If clinging conditions existence, and existence conditions birth, why not regard clinging and existence as the origin of suffering?"

世尊告曰：「愛能造作四種業故，一者此愛於其自體境界受中，能作貪味繫縛業故；二者此愛能作發起諸取業故；三者此愛能作令先所引行等成有業故；四者此愛能作死後續生業故。由是因緣，唯說此愛以為集諦。」
The World Honored One replied, "Craving produces four kinds of actions: Craving binds to the pleasant in one's own domain, provokes clinging actions, reinforces previously initiated actions into existence, and feeds post-mortem rebirth actions. Therefore, craving alone is declared the origin of suffering."

復言世尊！若生老死，名色六處觸受為相，於此生身何緣顯示生老死名。世尊告曰：「為顯如是生身之相，有三種苦成苦性故。」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! If birth, aging, death, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, and feeling characterize this body, why highlight birth, aging, and death?" The World Honored One replied, "To illustrate the body's nature, showcasing the three types of suffering as the essence of suffering."

復言：「世尊！生顯何苦？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What suffering does birth highlight?"

世尊告曰：「生顯行苦。」復言：「世尊！老顯何苦？」
The World Honored One replied, "Birth highlights the suffering of formations." Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What suffering does aging highlight?"

世尊告曰：「老顯壞苦。」復言：「世尊！死顯何苦？」
The World Honored One replied, "Aging highlights the suffering of decay." Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What suffering does death highlight?"

世尊告曰：「死顯苦苦。」復言：「世尊！如是四種生身之相，由生老死有何差別？」
The World Honored One replied, "Death highlights the suffering of suffering." Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! How do birth, aging, death, and the four body characteristics differ?"

世尊告曰：「即此四種生身之相，若次第生，若屬彼生，若如是生，應知是名生身生相。」
The World Honored One replied, "If these four body characteristics arise sequentially, belong to that arising, or arise in that manner, know this to be called the characteristics of a reborn body."

復言：「世尊！云何次第生身生相？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What are the sequential characteristics of a reborn body?"

世尊告曰：「於其最初有下種生，從此無間有漸增生，從此無間有出胎生，從此無間有漸長生。既成長已，受用言說能得等生，如是品類名次第生。」
The World Honored One replied, "Initially, there is the arising of the inferior seed; from this interval arises gradual growth; from this interval arises birth from the womb; from this interval arises gradual maturation. This maturation allows verbal expression and comprehension, thus termed sequential birth."

復言：「世尊！此屬誰生？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! To whom does this birth belong?"

世尊告曰：「蘊、界、處生都無有我。所以者何？以諸蘊等漸增長故，其性無常，即無常法有此生相。」
The World Honored One replied, "This birth belongs to the aggregates, realms, and sense bases, not to a self. Why? Because these aggregates gradually grow, their nature is impermanent. This impermanence defines these characteristics."

復言：「世尊！云何而生？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! How does it arise?"

世尊告曰：「由命根力有暫時住，分限法故，其性無常，即無常法如是而生。即此四種生身之相，時分變異，應知能作五種衰損，說名為老。」
The World Honored One replied, "Due to the life force, there is temporary residence. This segmented nature is impermanent. The characteristics arise from this impermanence. These four body characteristics undergo temporal changes, leading to five deteriorations, known as aging."

復言：「世尊！云何名為五種衰損？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! What are the five deteriorations?"

世尊告曰：「一者鬚髮衰損，以彼鬚髮色衰壞故；二者身相衰損，形色膚力皆衰損故；三者作業衰損，發言氣上喘息逾急，身戰掉故，住便僂曲，以其腰脊皆無力故，坐即低屈身羸弱故，行必按杖，身虛劣故，凡所思惟智識愚鈍，念惛亂故；四者受用衰損，於現資具，受用劣故，於戲樂具，一切不能現受用故，於諸色根所行境界，不能速疾明利而行，或不行故；五者命根衰損，壽量將盡，隣近死故，遇少死緣，不堪忍故。即於此四生身相中，復有六種死差別相：一者究竟死、二者不究竟死、三者自相死、四者不究竟死分差別相、五者究竟死分差別相、六者時非時死。應知此中自相死者，謂識離身，色相滅沒差別之相，如是名為生身相中名色等相由生老死而有差別。」
The World Honored One replied, "First, deterioration of hair and beard—its color fades. Second, deterioration of body form—shape, color, and skin weaken. Third, deterioration of actions—speech breathes rapidly, body trembles, standing stoops due to weakened spine, sitting haunches from frailty, walking relies on a cane due to bodily weakness. Contemplation dulls, memory falters. Fourth, deterioration of utility—current provisions used poorly, enjoyment of amusements diminishes, sensory activities sluggish or ineffective. Fifth, deterioration of the life force—lifespan nearing end, neighboring death, slightest cause unbearable."

復言：「世尊！於緣起中說三種愛，一切皆是生身之緣。何緣處處多分，唯說欲界生身？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! In the discourse on dependent origination, three types of craving are mentioned, all being conditions for the reborn body. Why then, is craving for the desire realm predominantly addressed?"

世尊告曰：「欲界生身相最麁故，易顯了故，非永解脫退還道故。」
The World Honored One replied, "The characteristics of the reborn body in the desire realm are the coarsest, hence more conspicuous and not pertaining to the path of final liberation and reversion."

復言：「世尊！如先所說諸引緣起，諸生緣起有十二分，於諸分中，幾是能引？幾是所引？幾是能生？幾是所生？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! In the previously described dependent origination, composed of twelve links, which are the conditioning links? Which are the conditioned? Which generate formations? Which are engendered?"

世尊告曰：「應知於此十二分中，無明與行及識一分，名為能引；復有一分識及名色、六處、觸、受，名為所引；復有一分受、愛、取、有，名為能生；生及老死名為所生，應知一分名色、六處及與觸、受，亦名所生。」
The World Honored One replied, "Among these twelve links, ignorance, formations, and consciousness are known as conditioning. Consciousness along with name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, and feeling are conditioned. Feeling, craving, clinging, and becoming are generative. Birth and aging-and-death are engendered. Name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, and feeling are also considered engendered."

復言：「世尊！如是諸分，若引若生，為一時起？為次第起？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! These various links, whether conditioning or generative, do they arise simultaneously or sequentially?"

世尊告曰：「一時而起，次第宣說。」
The World Honored One replied, "They arise simultaneously but are explained sequentially."

復言：「世尊！如是諸分，若一時起，何因緣故，先說其引後說其生？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Since these links arise simultaneously, why then, is the conditioning described first and the generative after?"

世尊告曰：「要由有引後有方生，非無引故。」
The World Honored One replied, "The generative arises because of the prior conditioning; without conditioning, generation does not occur."

復言：「世尊！無明亦緣非理作意，何故唯說無明為緣？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! Misdirected thoughts are also conditioned by ignorance; why then, is ignorance alone said to be the condition?"

世尊告曰：「無明亦引非理作意與行為緣，又從無明所生觸受為緣生愛，是故偏說。」
The World Honored One replied, "Ignorance conditions misdirected thoughts and formations, and these, in turn, lead to craving through contact and feeling born of ignorance. Hence, ignorance is predominantly emphasized."

復言：「世尊！略由幾相應知緣起？」
Continuing, the bhikṣu asked, "World Honored One! By which concise factors should dependent origination be understood?"

世尊告曰：「略由三相應知緣起：一者由無動作知緣起相，二者由性無常知緣起相，三者由有堪能知緣起相。」
The World Honored One replied, "Dependent origination should be understood by three concise factors: first, by recognizing the lack of inherent action; second, by observing its impermanent nature; third, by its potentiality."
