Tell me what division/section this is, any titles or sections, and briefly summarize this juan **only** of the chinese Yogacarabhumisastra, providing your answer in english noting translations. No need to summarize the treatise in general, just this juan.
The excerpt from Volume Four of the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra, spoken by Maitreya Bodhisattva and translated by Dharma Master Xuánzàng, delves into an elaborate discussion of the various realms of existence as understood in Buddhist cosmology, focusing on the realms of desire (Kāmadhātu), form (Rūpadhātu), and the formless (Ārūpyadhātu), as well as the experiences of beings within these realms and the nature of suffering and pleasure that pervades them.

The section categorizes and describes the different types of realms:
- **Realms of Desire:** It details the suffering inherent in the hells (naraka) with vivid descriptions of punitive sufferings, the plight of hungry ghosts (preta) characterized by their insatiable hunger and thirst, and the various pains and pleasures experienced by humans and gods within this realm.
- **Realms of Form:** Discusses the elevated states of existence of beings in the form realms, where physical and sensual pleasures are refined, and highlights the characteristics of these beings and their dwellings.
- **Formless Realms:** Briefly mentions that beings here do not experience physical or sensual suffering and pleasure in the way beings in the desire and form realms do because of the absence of physical form.

The text goes into great detail on the nature of suffering in different realms, emphasizing the agonies faced by beings in the hells and the hungry ghost realm, contrasting these with the pleasures enjoyed by gods and humans. However, it also nuances the apparently enviable existence of gods by outlining the eventual sufferings they too face, such as the fear and discomfort experienced when they are about to die or fall from their celestial realms.

Additionally, the text touches upon the karmic causes behind the rebirth in various realms, suggesting that actions rooted in greed, anger, and delusion lead to rebirth in lower realms, while positive karmic actions facilitate birth in higher realms like that of humans or gods.

Moreover, the text describes the advanced states of Brahma realms within the form realm, their peaceful existence, and the kinds of pleasures devoid of lower sensual gratifications, emphasizing the tranquility and subtlety of existence in these higher realms as opposed to the torments described in lower realms.

This volume serves as an exploration of samsaric existence across its various layers, vividly painting the Buddhist cosmological view of the cyclic nature of life and death (samsara), the nuances of karmic retribution, and the possibility of transcending suffering through spiritual practice.

Tripiṭaka Dharma Master Xuánzàng, commissioned by imperial decree, translated

本地分中有尋有伺等三地之一
In this section, first among the three grounds of seeking (vitarka), reflecting (vicāra), etc.

已說意地。
The thinking ground (mano-bhūmi) has been explained.

云何有尋有伺地？云何無尋唯伺地？云何無尋無伺地？
How is there a ground with seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra)? How is there a ground without seeking (vitarka), only with reflecting (vicāra)? How is there a ground without both seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra)?

總嗢拕南曰：
It is generally said:

界、相、如理、不如理、　　雜染等起最為後。
In summary, it is said:

如是三地，略以五門施設建立。一、界施設建立，二、相施設建立，三、如理作意施設建立，四、不如理作意施設建立，五、雜染等起施設建立。
Thus, these three grounds are provisionally established through five approaches:
1) Establishment through defining realms (dhātus),
2) Establishment through defining characteristics (lakṣaṇas),
3) Establishment through "attention wrt essense" (tathābhūta-manaskāra),
4) Establishment through "inverted attention" (viparyāsa-manaskāra),
5) Establishment through the arising of mixed defilements (saṃkleśa).

云何界施設建立？
How are realms (dhātus) provisionally established?

別嗢拕南曰：
It is specifically said:

數、處、量、壽、受用、生、　　自體、因緣果分別。
Enumeration, location, measure, lifespan, experience, birth, inherent nature, cause, condition, result and differentiation (vikalpa).

當知界建立由八種相。一、數建立，二、處建立，三、有情量建立，四、有情壽建立，五、有情受用建立，六、生建立，七、自體建立，八、因緣果建立。
It should be understood that the establishment through defining realms is based on eight characteristics:
1) Establishment through enumeration,
2) Establishment through location,
3) Establishment through the measure of sentient beings,
4) Establishment through the lifespan of sentient beings,
5) Establishment through the experiences of sentient beings,
6) Establishment through birth,
7) Establishment through inherent nature,
8) Establishment through cause, condition, and result.

云何數建立？略有三界。謂欲界、色界、無色界。如是三種，名墮攝界。
How is the establishment through enumeration? Broadly, there are three realms. These are the realm of desire (kāmadhātu), the realm of form (rūpadhātu), and the formless realm (ārūpyadhātu). These three types are collectively known as the encompassed realms.

非墮攝界者，謂方便，并薩迦耶滅，及無戲論無漏界。
Those that do not fall within these encompassed realms, refer to a realm of skillful method (upāya), together with "Sākya-Nirvāṇa", and a realm without concepts or "outflows".

此中欲界及色界初靜慮，除靜慮中間若定、若生，名有尋有伺地。
Within these, the realm of desire and the first absorbtion (dhyāna) of the realm of form (rūpadhātu), excluding the intermediate stages of absorbtion or emerging from absorbtion, are named as the ground with seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra).

即靜慮中間若定、若生，名無尋唯伺地。隨一有情，由修此故，得為大梵。
The intermediate stages of absorbtion (dhyāna), whether in absorption or emerging from it, are named as the ground without seeking (vitarka) but only with reflecting (vicāra). Any sentient being, by cultivating this, therefore attains the position of Great Brahma (Mahābrahmā).

從第二靜慮，餘有色界及無色界全，名無尋無伺地。
From the second absorption (dhyāna), the remaining form realm and the entire formless realm are named as the ground without both seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra).

此中由離尋伺欲道理故，說名無尋無伺地，不由不現行故。
In this respect, because of departing from seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra), it is said to be the ground without seeking and without reflecting, not because of the absence of saṃskāra.

所以者何？未離欲界欲者，由教導作意差別故，於一時間亦有無尋無伺意現行。
What is the reason for this? Those who have not yet departed from the realm of desire (kāmadhātu), due to being directed to attend differently, also appear without seeking (vitarka) and without reflecting (vicāra), at the same time.

已離尋伺欲者，亦有尋伺現行。如出彼定、及生彼者。
For those who have departed from seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra) desire (kāma), there is also the presence of seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra). This applies to those emerging from absorbtion (dhyāna) and those entering.

若無漏界有為定所攝初靜慮，亦名有尋有伺地。依尋伺處法，緣真如為境入此定故，不由分別現行故。
When the "realm without outflows" is conditioned by the first absorption (dhyāna), it is called the ground with seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra). Dependent upon the objects of seeking (vitarka) and reflecting (vicāra), such as the principle of suchness (tathatā), one enters this absorption (dhyāna).

餘如前說。
The rest are the same.

處所建立者，於欲界中有三十六處。謂八大那落迦。
In the establishment through location, within the realm of desire (kāmadhātu), there are thirty-six locations. These include the eight great hells.

何等為八？一、等活，二、黑繩，三、眾合，四、號叫，五、大號叫，六、燒熱，七、極燒熱，八、無間。此諸大那落迦處，廣十千踰繕那。此外復有八寒那落迦處。何等為八？一、皰那落迦，二、皰裂那落迦，三、𠿒哳詀那落迦，四、郝郝凡那落迦，五、虎虎凡那落迦，六、青蓮那落迦，七、紅蓮那落迦，八、大紅蓮那落迦。從此下三萬二千踰繕那，至等活那落迦。從此復隔四千踰繕那，有餘那落迦。如等活大那落迦處，初寒那落迦處亦爾。從此復隔二千踰繕那，有餘那落迦應知。又有餓鬼處所。又有非天處所。傍生即與人天同處，故不別建立。復有四大洲，如前說。復有八中洲。又欲界天有六處。一、四大王眾天，二、三十三天，三、時分天，四、知足天，五、樂化天，六、他化自在天。復有摩羅天宮，即他化自在天攝，然處所高勝。復有獨一那落迦、近邊那落迦，即大那落迦及寒那落迦。以近邊故，不別立處。又於人中，亦有一分獨一那落迦可得。如尊者取菉豆子說：我見諸有情，燒然、極燒然、遍極燒然，總一燒然聚。如是等三十六處，總名欲界。
What are the eight?

1) Saṃjīva,
2) Kālasūtra,
3) Saṃghāta,
4) Raurava,
5) Mahāraurava,
6) Tapana,
7) Pratāpana, and
8) Avīci.

These places in the great hells extend across ten thousand yojanas.

Beyond these, there are also eight cold hells. What are the eight?

1) Arbuda,
2) Nirarbuda,
3) Aṭaṭa,
4) Hahava,
5) Huhuva,
6) Utpala,
7) Padma, and
8) Mahāpadma.

From these down thirty-two thousand yojanas, to the Saṃjīva hell. Four thousand yojanas below these, there are other hells. As with the place of the great Saṃjīva hell, the first of the cold hells is similar. Two thousand yojanas beyond these, other hells are to be understood.

There are also the places of the hungry ghosts. There are also the places of the asuras. As births among these are alongside humans and gods, they are not established separately.

There are also the four great continents, as previously mentioned.

There are also the eight intermediary continents.

In the desire realm, there are six heavenly places:

1) Cāturmahārājika heaven,
2) Trāyastriṃśa heaven,
3) Yāma heaven,
4) Tuṣita heaven,
5) Nirmāṇarati heaven,
6) Paranirmitavaśavartin heaven.

There is also the Māra's palace, which is included in the Paranirmitavaśavartin heaven, yet distinguished by its superior location.

There are also the solitary hells and neighboring hells, which include the great hells and cold hells. Due to their proximity, they are not established as separate places.

Among humans, there is also a part that can be attained as the solitary hell. As the venerable said regarding the Udumbara flower: "I see all sentient beings, burning, severely burning, universally severely burning, totally in a single burning assembly." Thus, these thirty-six places are collectively named the desire realm.

復次，色界有十八處。謂梵眾天、梵前益天、大梵天，此三由軟中上品熏修初靜慮故。少光天、無量光天、極淨光天，此三由軟中上品熏修第二靜慮故。少淨天、無量淨天、遍淨天，此三由軟中上品熏修第三靜慮故。無雲天、福生天、廣果天，此三由軟中上品熏修第四靜慮故。無想天即廣果攝，無別處所。復有諸聖，住止不共五淨宮地。謂無煩、無熱、善現、善見及色究竟。由軟、中、上、上勝、上極品雜熏修第四靜慮故。復有超過淨宮大自在住處。有十地菩薩，由極熏修第十地故，得生其中。
Furthermore, the form realm (Rūpadhātu) consists of eighteen locations. These include:

1) Brahmakāyika heaven,
2) Brahmakāya heaven,
3) Mahābrahma heaven,
These three are due to the cultivation of the first absorption (dhyāna) in its inferior, middling, and superior aspects.

4) Parittābha heaven,
5) Apramāṇābha heaven,
6) Ābhāsvara heaven,
These three are due to the cultivation of the second absorption in its inferior, middling, and superior aspects.

7) Parīttaśubha heaven,
8) Apramāṇaśubha heaven,
9) Śubhakṛtsna heaven,
These three are due to the cultivation of the third absorption in its inferior, middling, and superior aspects.

10) Anabhraka heaven,
11) Śubhaprāpti heaven,
12) Bṛhatphala heaven,
These three are due to the cultivation of the fourth absorption in its inferior, middling, and superior aspects.

The realm of no-thought (Asaññasatta) is included within the Bṛhatphala heaven, having no separate location.

Furthermore, there are the sacred realms, the unwavering abodes of purification, which include:

1) Avṛha,
2) Atapa,
3) Sudṛśa,
4) Sudarśana,
5) Akaniṣṭha,

Due to the mixed cultivation of the fourth absorption in its inferior, middling, superior, more superior, and most superior aspects.

Additionally, there exists a dwelling place of supreme independence beyond the pure abodes, where Bodhisattvas of the tenth ground are born by virtue of their profound cultivation of the tenth ground, achieving birth therein.

復次，無色界有四處所，或無處所。
Furthermore, the formless realm (Ārūpyadhātu) consists of four locations, or rather, it is without locations.

有情量建立者，謂贍部洲人身量不定，或時高大，或時卑小，然隨自肘三肘半量。東毘提訶身量決定，亦隨自肘三肘半量，身又高大。如東毘提訶如是，西瞿陀尼、北拘盧洲身量亦爾，轉復高大。四大王眾天身量如拘盧舍四分之一。三十三天身量復增一足。帝釋身量半拘盧舍。時分天身量亦半拘盧舍。此上一切，如欲界天身量，當知漸漸各增一足。梵眾天身量半踰繕那。梵前益天身量一踰繕那。大梵天身量一踰繕那半。少光天身量二踰繕那。此上一切餘天身量各漸倍增。除無雲天。應知彼天減三踰繕那。又大那落迦身量不定。若作及增長極重惡不善業者，彼感身形其量廣大；餘則不爾。如大那落迦如是，寒那落迦、獨一那落迦、近邊那落迦、傍生、餓鬼亦爾。諸非天身量大小，如三十三天。當知無色界無有色故，無有身量。
In the establishment through the measure of sentient beings:

- The height of humans in Jambudvīpa varies; sometimes they are tall and sometimes they are short, but generally around three and a half elbows tall according to their own measure.
- In the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha, the height of beings is fixed, also at three and a half elbow lengths, but their bodies are larger. As in Pūrvavideha, so too the heights of beings in the western continent of Aparagodānīya and the northern continent of Uttarakuru; their stature progressively increases.
- The height of beings in the realm of the Four Great Kings is one quarter that of those in Uttarakuru.
- In the realm of the Thirty-Three Gods, the height increases by one foot.
- The height of Indra (Śakra) is half that of Uttarakuru.
- The height in the realm of the Yāma devas is also half that of Uttarakuru.
- Above this, all the way to the desire realm heavens, the height of beings gradually increases by one foot for each successive realm.
- In the Brahmakāyika heaven, the height is half a yojana.
- In the realm of Brahma's Retinue, the height is one yojana.
- In the Great Brahma realm, the height is one and a half yojanas.
- In the Minor Luminosity realm, the height is two yojanas, and for all higher realms above this, the height of beings doubles progressively, except in the realm without clouds, where it is understood that the height decreases by three yojanas.
- The height of beings in the great hells is not fixed. Those who perform extremely heavy negative actions causing them to be reborn there have a very large physical form; this is not the case for others. As with the great hells, so too for the cold hells, the solitary hells, the neighboring hells, beings born in parallel existences, and hungry ghosts.
- The size of asuras is similar to that of the beings in the realm of the Thirty-Three Gods.
- It should be understood that in the formless realm, there is no corporeal form, and thus no measurement of physical bodies exists.

壽建立者，謂贍部洲人壽量不定。彼人以三十日夜為一月，十二月為一歲。或於一時壽無量歲，或於一時壽八萬歲，或於一時壽量漸減乃至十歲。東毘提訶人壽量決定二百五十歲。西瞿陀尼人壽量決定五百歲。北拘盧洲人壽量決定千歲。又人間五十歲是四大王眾天一日一夜。以此日夜，三十日夜為一月，十二月為一歲。彼諸天眾壽量五百歲。人間百歲是三十三天一日一夜。以此日夜如前說，彼諸天眾壽量千歲。如是所餘，乃至他化自在天，日夜及壽量各增前一倍。又四大王眾天滿足壽量是等活大那落迦一日一夜。即以此三十日夜為一月，十二月為一歲。彼大那落迦壽五百歲。以四大王眾天壽量成等活大那落迦壽量，如是以三十三天壽量成黑繩大那落迦壽量，以時分天壽量成眾合大那落迦壽量，以知足天壽量成號叫大那落迦壽量，以樂化天壽量成大號叫大那落迦壽量，以他化自在天壽量成燒熱大那落迦壽量，應知亦爾。極燒熱大那落迦有情壽半中劫。無間大那落迦有情壽一中劫。非天壽量如三十三天。傍生、餓鬼壽量不定。又寒那落迦於大那落迦次第相望，壽量近半應知。又近邊那落迦、獨一那落迦受生有情壽量不定。梵眾天壽二十中劫一劫，梵前益天壽四十中劫一劫，大梵天壽六十中劫一劫，少光天壽八十中劫二劫。自此以上，餘色界天壽量相望，各漸倍增。唯除無雲。當知彼天壽減三劫。空無邊處壽二萬劫，識無邊處壽四萬劫，無所有處壽六萬劫，非想非非想處壽八萬劫。除北拘盧洲，餘一切處悉有中夭。又人、鬼、傍生趣有餘滓身；天及那落迦與識俱沒，無餘滓身。
In terms of lifespan:

- The lifespan of humans in Jambudvīpa is not fixed. They count thirty days and nights as one month, and twelve months as one year. At times, their lifespan is immeasurable, at other times eighty thousand years, and sometimes it progressively decreases to just ten years.
- The lifespan of people in the continent of Pūrvavideha is fixed at two hundred and fifty years.
- In the western continent of Aparagodānīya, the lifespan is fixed at five hundred years.
- In the northern continent of Uttarakuru, the lifespan is fixed at one thousand years.
- In the human realm, fifty years equal one day and one night in the realm of the Four Great Kings. Based on this day and night, thirty days and nights make one month, and twelve months make one year, with a total lifespan of five hundred years for these devas.
- In the human realm, one hundred years equate to one day and one night in the realm of the Thirty-Three Gods. Following the same calculation as before, the total lifespan in this realm is one thousand years. From here onward, up to the Parinirmitavaśavartin heaven, the length of day and night and the lifespan double compared to the preceding realm.
- The full lifespan in the realm of the Four Great Kings equals one day and one night in Saṃjīva hell, calculated as thirty days and nights making one month, and twelve months making one year, totaling five hundred years of lifespan in this hell.
- The lifespan in the dark hells such as Kālasūtra, Saṃghāta, up to Avīci increases progressively, based on the lifespan quantifications of the heavenly realms mentioned earlier.
- The lifespan of beings in Raurava is half a kalpa, while in Avīci, it is a full kalpa.
- The lifespan in the asura realm is similar to that in the realm of the Thirty-Three Gods, while the lifespan of beings in parallel existences and hungry ghosts is not fixed.
- In the cold hells, the lifespan is roughly half compared to the corresponding hot hells.
- The lifespan of beings in solitary hells and neighboring hells is not fixed.
- In the Brahmakāyika heaven, the lifespan is twenty medium kalpas; in the Brahmakāya heaven, it's forty medium kalpas; in the Great Brahma heaven, sixty medium kalpas; in the Minor Luminosity heaven, eighty medium kalpas and two kalpas. From here onward, life spans in the higher realms of the form realm double progressively, except for Anabhraka, where the lifespan decreases by three kalpas.
- In the formless realm, the lifespan in Ākāśānantyāyatana is twenty thousand kalpas, in Vijñānānantyāyatana is forty thousand kalpas, in Ākiñcañyāyatana is sixty thousand kalpas, and in Naivaṣaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana is eighty thousand kalpas.
- Except for Uttarakuru, all other locations experience untimely deaths. Additionally, humans, ghosts, and beings in parallel existences may have residual bodies; however, in the heavens and hells, beings perish along with their consciousness, leaving no residual form.

受用建立者，略有三種。謂受用苦樂、受用飲食、受用婬欲。
In the establishment of experiences, there are generally three types: experiencing suffering and happiness, experiencing food and drink, and experiencing sexual desire.

受用苦樂者，謂那落迦有情多分受用極治罰苦；傍生有情多分受用相食噉苦；餓鬼有情多分受用極飢渴苦；人趣有情多分受用匱乏追求種種之苦；天趣有情多分受用衰惱墜沒之苦。
Regarding the experience of suffering and happiness, beings in hell endure extreme punitive suffering for the most part; beings in intermediate states suffer mainly from being eaten and chewed; beings as hungry ghosts suffer predominantly from extreme hunger and thirst; humans mostly endure various sufferings from scarcity and pursuit; and beings in heavenly realms mainly experience the suffering of decay and downfall.

又於等活大那落迦中，多受如是極治罰苦。謂彼有情，多共聚集，業增上生，種種苦具次第而起，更相殘害，悶絕躄地。次虛空中有大聲發，唱如是言：此諸有情可還等活！可還等活！次彼有情欻然復起，復由如前所說苦具更相殘害。由此因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名為等活。
Also, within Saṃjīva, the great hell, beings mostly endure such extreme punitive suffering. It is said that beings gather together, and due to their karmic influences, various instruments of torture arise sequentially, inflicting mutual harm and leaving them writhing on the ground. Subsequently, from the sky, a great voice declares, "These beings may return to Saṃjīva! They may return to Saṃjīva!" Then, those beings suddenly revive and once again undergo torture by the previously mentioned instruments, perpetuating mutual harm. Due to this cause and effect, they suffer for an extended period until all the negative karma they have accumulated in previous lives has been completely exhausted. Hence, this hell is named Saṃjīva (Reviving).

又於黑繩大那落迦中，多受如是治罰重苦。謂彼有情多分為彼所攝獄卒以黑繩拼之，或為四方、或為八方、或為種種圖畵文像。彼既拼已，隨其處所，若鑿、若斲、若斫、若剜。由如是等種種因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名為黑繩。
Also, within the Kālasūtra, the great hell, beings mostly endure such severe punitive suffering. It is described that these beings are often bound tightly with black ropes by jailers in various patterns, including square, octagonal, or various artistic designs. Once bound, depending on their location, they are subject to sawing, hacking, chopping, or gouging. For such reasons, among others, they suffer for a long time until all the negative karma they have generated in past lives has been fully exhausted. Hence, this hell is named Kālasūtra (Black Rope).

又於眾合大那落迦中，多受如是治罰重苦。謂彼有情，或時展轉聚集和合，爾時便有彼攝獄卒驅逼令入兩鐵羺頭大山之間。彼既入已，兩山迫之；既被迫已，一切門中血便流注。如兩鐵羺頭，如是兩鐵羝頭、兩鐵馬頭、兩鐵象頭、兩鐵師子頭、兩鐵虎頭亦爾。復令和合，置大鐵槽中，便即壓之，如壓甘蔗。既被壓已，血便流注。復和合已，有大鐵山從上而墮，令彼有情躄在鐵地，若斫若刺，或擣或裂。既被斫刺及擣裂已，血便流注。由此因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所作一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名為眾合。
Also, within the Saṃghāta, the great hell, beings mostly endure such severe punitive suffering. It is described that beings sometimes gather together and when they do, prison guards of that realm force them into two huge mountains made of iron that come together. Once the beings are inside, the mountains crush them; after being crushed, blood flows from every orifice. Like mountains shaped as iron wheels, so too with mountains shaped as iron oxen, horses, elephants, lions, and tigers. They are then made to merge again, placed within a large iron trough, and then pressed as if sugarcane. After being pressed, with blood flowing profusely, they are then combined again, and a great iron mountain falls upon them from above. Forcing those beings onto an iron floor, they are hacked, stabbed, pounded, and torn apart. After being hacked, stabbed, pounded, and torn, the blood flows out profusely. Because of these reasons, they suffer for a long time, until all the negative karma they have accumulated in past lifetimes, which has not yet been exhausted, is exhausted. Therefore, this hell is named Saṃghāta.

又於號叫大那落迦中，多受如是治罰重苦。謂彼有情尋求舍宅，便入大鐵室中。彼纔入已，即便火起；由此燒然，若極燒然，遍極燒然。既被燒已，苦痛逼切，發聲號叫。由此因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名為號叫。
Also, within the Raurava, the great hell, beings mostly endure such severe punitive suffering. These beings, in their search for shelter, enter a great iron house. As soon as they enter, fire erupts; due to this, they burn, severely burn, and are wholly engulfed in extreme burning. Having been burnt, they experience intense pain and scream. Because of this, they suffer for a long time until all the evil karma they have accumulated in previous lives, which has not yet been exhausted, is exhausted. Hence, this hell is named Raurava.

又於大號叫大那落迦中，所受苦惱與此差別。謂彼室宅其如胎藏。故此那落迦名大號叫。
In the Mahāraurava, the great hell, the suffering experienced is distinct from the previously mentioned. This is because the structure of the residences there is like a womb. Therefore, this hell is named Mahāraurava (Great Wailing).

又於燒熱大那落迦中，多受如是治罰重苦。謂彼所攝獄卒，以諸有情置無量踰繕那熱、極熱、遍極燒然大鐵𨫼上，左右轉之，表裏燒煿。又如炙魚，以大鐵丳從下貫之，徹頂而出，反覆炙之，令彼有情諸根毛孔及以口中悉皆焰起。復以有情置熱、極熱、遍極燒然大鐵地上，或仰或覆，以熱、極熱、遍極燒然大鐵椎棒，或打或築、遍打遍築，令如肉摶。由此因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名為燒熱。
Also, within the Tapana, the great hell, beings mostly endure such severe punitive suffering. The jailers in charge place sentient beings on a great iron grid over immense, extremely hot, all-encompassing burning fires. They are turned over from side to side, their entire bodies being scorched. Similarly to grilling fish, a large iron skewer is threaded through them from below, coming out at the top, and they are repeatedly flipped over the fire, causing flames to emerge from every pore and orifice of the beings. Furthermore, sentient beings are placed on a great iron ground that is hot, extremely hot, and all-encompassingly burning. Whether they are placed face up or face down, they are beaten and pounded with iron mallets that are hot, extremely hot, and all-encompassingly burning, pulverizing them like mincing meat. Due to these causes and conditions, they suffer for a long time, until all the negative karma they have accumulated in previous lives, which has not yet been exhausted, is exhausted. Therefore, this hell is named Tapana.

Furthermore, in the Pratāpana, the great hell, the suffering experienced is distinct. Three large, hot iron skewers are threaded through them from below, coming out through both arms and the top of the head. Due to this, flames burst forth from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and all pores. They are also entirely wrapped in burning hot copper or iron sheets. Additionally, they are overturned and placed in a vast iron cauldron filled with boiling greyish water, being fried and boiled therein. As the boiling water surges, the beings are tossed about, either surfacing or sinking, with their flesh, skin, and veins all melting away, leaving only bones. They are then strained out, placed on the iron ground, and their flesh and skin are restored as before, only to be placed back into the cauldron. The remaining sufferings are as described for Tapana. Because of these causes and conditions, they suffer for a long time, until all the negative karma leading to being born in such a hell, which has not yet been exhausted, is exhausted. Therefore, this hell is named Pratāpana.

Additionally, in the Avīci, the great hell, the beings constantly endure such extreme punitive sufferings. From the eastern direction across many hundred yojanas, a fiercely burning, extremely hot, all-encompassingly burning fire on a great iron ground comes, piercing the beings, passing through skin into flesh, severing tendons, breaking bones, and even penetrating the marrow, burning them as if they were candles. This happens from all directions—east, south, west, and north alike. Therefore, these beings are mixed with fierce flames, seen from all directions as conglomerates of fire without any gaps, experiencing unending intense suffering. Only the sounds of intense suffering and wailing are heard, indicating the presence of living beings. They are also sifted with burning, extremely hot, all-encompassingly burning iron coals in iron baskets. They are made to climb hot iron mountains, going up and then down. Their tongues are pulled out, nailed down with hundred iron nails, stretched without wrinkles, like spreading cowhide. Then, while lying on their backs on the hot iron ground, their mouths are forced open with hot iron tongs, and extremely hot burning iron balls are placed into their mouths, burning through the mouth and throat, penetrating the internal organs, and exiting from below. Moreover, molten copper is poured into their mouths, burning through the throat and mouth, penetrating the internal organs, and flowing out from below. The remaining sufferings are as described for extreme heat. Due to these causes and conditions, they suffer for a long time, until all the negative karma that can be felt in the hells, which has not yet been exhausted, is exhausted. This hell is named Avīci, where beings are born because of the uninterrupted (continuous) karma they have created. This briefly explains the manifest sufferings, but it does not mean that other various agonies in such great hells are not found.

又於極燒熱大那落迦中，所受苦惱與此差別。謂以三支大熱鐵丳從下貫之，徹其兩膊及頂而出。由此因緣，眼耳鼻口及諸毛孔猛焰流出。又以熱、極熱、遍極燒然大銅鐵鍱遍裹其身。又復倒擲置熱、極熱、遍極燒然彌滿灰水大鐵鑊中而煎煮之。其湯涌沸，令此有情隨湯飄轉，或出或沒，令其血肉及以皮脈悉皆銷爛、唯骨瑣在，尋復漉之，置鐵地上，令其皮肉及以血脈復生如故，還置鑊中。餘如燒熱大那落迦說。由此因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名極燒熱。
Furthermore, in the Pratāpana, the great hell, the suffering experienced is distinct. Three large, hot iron skewers are threaded through them from below, coming out through both arms and the top of the head. Due to this, flames burst forth from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and all pores. They are also entirely wrapped in burning hot copper or iron sheets. Additionally, they are overturned and placed in a vast iron cauldron filled with boiling greyish water, being fried and boiled therein. As the boiling water surges, the beings are tossed about, either surfacing or sinking, with their flesh, skin, and veins all melting away, leaving only bones. They are then strained out, placed on the iron ground, and their flesh and skin are restored as before, only to be placed back into the cauldron. The remaining sufferings are as described for Tapana. Because of these causes and conditions, they suffer for a long time, until all the negative karma leading to being born in such a hell, which has not yet been exhausted, is exhausted. Therefore, this hell is named Pratāpana.

又於無間大那落迦中，彼諸有情恒受如是極治罰苦。謂從東方多百踰繕那燒熱、極燒熱、遍極燒然大鐵地上有猛熾火騰焰而來，刺彼有情，穿皮入肉，斷筋破骨，復徹其髓，燒如脂燭，如是舉身皆成猛焰。如從東方，南西北方亦復如是。由此因緣，彼諸有情與猛焰和雜，唯見火聚從四方來，火焰和雜，無有間隙，所受苦痛亦無間隙，唯聞苦逼號叫之聲，知有眾生。又以鐵箕盛滿燒然、極燒然、遍極燒然猛焰鐵炭而簸剪之。復置熱鐵地上，令登大熱鐵山，上而復下，下而復上。從其口中拔出其舌，以百鐵釘釘而張之，令無皺襵，如張牛皮。復更仰臥熱鐵地上，以熱燒鐵鉗鉗口令開，以燒然、極燒然、遍極燒然大熱鐵丸置其口中，即燒其口及以咽喉，徹於府藏，從下而出。又以洋銅而灌其口，燒喉及口，徹於府藏，從下流出。所餘苦惱，如極熱說。由此因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切惡不善業未盡未出。故此那落迦名為無間，多是造作無間之業來生是中。此但略說麁顯苦具，非於如是大那落迦中，所餘種種眾多苦具而不可得。
Additionally, in the Avīci, the great hell, the beings constantly endure such extreme punitive sufferings. From the eastern direction, across many hundred yojanas, a fiercely burning, extremely hot, all-encompassingly burning fire on a great iron ground comes, piercing the beings, passing through skin into flesh, severing tendons, breaking bones, and even penetrating the marrow, burning them as if they were candles.

This briefly explains the manifest sufferings, but it does not mean that other various agonies in such great hells are not found.

又於近邊諸那落迦中，有情之類受用如是治罰重苦。謂彼一切諸大那落迦皆有四方、四岸、四門，鐵牆圍遶。從其四方四門出已，其一一門外有四出園。謂煻煨齊膝。彼諸有情出求舍宅，遊行至此，下足之時、皮肉及血，並即消爛，舉足還生。次此煻煨無間，即有死屍糞泥。此諸有情為求舍宅，從彼出已，漸漸遊行，陷入其中，首足俱沒。又屍糞埿內多有諸蟲，名孃矩吒，穿皮入肉，斷筋破骨，取髓而食。次屍糞埿無間，有利刀劍仰刃為路。彼諸有情為求舍宅，從彼出已，遊行至此。下足之時，皮肉筋血悉皆消爛，舉足之時，還復如故。次刀劍刃路無間，有刃葉林。彼諸有情為求舍宅，從彼出已，往趣彼蔭，纔坐其下，微風遂起，刃葉墮落，斫截其身一切支節，便即躄地。有黑黧狗，摣掣脊𦛗而噉食之。從此刃葉林無間，有鐵設拉末梨林。彼諸有情為求舍宅，便來趣之，遂登其上。當登之時，一切刺鋒悉迴向下，欲下之時，一切刺鋒復迴向上。由此因緣，貫刺其身，遍諸支節。爾時便有鐵㭰大烏上彼頭上，或上其髆，探啄眼睛而噉食之。從鐵設拉末梨林無間，有廣大河，沸熱灰水彌滿其中。彼諸有情尋求舍宅，從彼出已，來墮此中。猶如以豆置之大鑊，然猛熾火而煎煮之，隨湯騰涌周旋迴復。於河兩岸有諸獄卒，手執杖索及以大網，行列而住，遮彼有情，不令得出，或以索羂，或以網漉。復置廣大熱鐵地上，仰彼有情而問之言：汝等今者欲何所須？如是答言：我等今者竟無覺知，然為種種飢苦所逼。時彼獄卒即以鐵鉗鉗口令開，便以極熱燒然鐵丸置其口中，餘如前說。若彼答言：我今唯為渴苦所逼。爾時獄卒便即洋銅以灌其口。由是因緣，長時受苦，乃至先世所造一切能感那落迦惡不善業未盡未出。此中若刀劍刃路、若刃葉林、若鐵設拉末梨林總之為一，故有四園。
Also, in the neighboring hells, beings endure such severe punitive sufferings. All the great hells are encompassed by four sides, four banks, and four gates, surrounded by iron walls. Exiting through each of these four gates, there is a garden. For instance, when beings step on the hot ashes, their skin, flesh, and blood immediately disintegrate upon contact, only to regenerate when they lift their feet. Following this ash-covered area, there’s a marsh of dead bodies and feces. Beings seeking shelter traverse these areas and, upon entering, they sink with both head and feet submerged. Moreover, within this morass of corpses and feces, there are numerous worms, known as "Nama-kūṭa", which penetrate the skin to eat the flesh, sever the tendons, break the bones, and consume the marrow.

Following this marsh, there’s a path laid with sharp blades facing upwards. Beings seeking shelter, upon stepping here, find their skin, flesh, tendons, and blood completely disintegrate upon contacting the blades, only to regenerate when they lift their feet. Beyond this blade-strewn path lies a forest with leaves as sharp as razors. Beings seeking shelter, upon sitting beneath them, experience a light breeze causing the razor leaves to fall, severing all their limbs, and forcing them to the ground. Here, dark, fierce dogs tear at their spines and consume them.

Further on, there’s a forest of "Iron Stinging Nettle Trees". Beings climbing these trees find that the spikes turn downwards when ascending and upwards when trying to descend, piercing through their bodies entirely. Iron crows then perch on their heads or shoulders, pecking out and eating their eyes.

Beyond this forest lies a vast river filled with boiling, scalding greyish water. Beings falling into it are cooked and boiled like beans in a pot over a fierce fire, tossed and turned by the bubbling broth. On both banks of the river, jailers armed with rods, lassos, and large nets stand in rows, preventing the beings from escaping, capturing them with lassos or netting them when they try to get out.

Placed on the vast hot iron ground, these beings are asked by the jailers what they desire. Responding that they are unaware but are driven by various kinds of hunger, the jailers then force their mouths open with iron tongs and place extremely hot, burning iron balls inside their mouths, as previously described. If the beings respond that they are tormented by thirst, the jailers immediately pour molten copper into their mouths.

Due to these reasons, they suffer for a long time, until all the evil karma appropriate for the hells that they have accumulated in previous lives has not been exhausted. The path with blades, the forest with razor leaves, and the forest of "Iron Stinging Nettle Trees" collectively make one of the gardens, resulting in four gardens in total.

又於寒那落迦受生有情，多受如是極重寒苦。謂皰那落迦中受生有情，即為彼地極重廣大寒觸所觸，一切身分悉皆卷縮，猶如瘡皰。故此那落迦名皰那落迦。皰裂那落迦與此差別。猶如皰潰，膿血流出，其瘡卷皺。故此那落迦名為皰裂。又𠿒哳詀、郝郝凡、虎虎凡、此三那落迦由彼有情苦音差別以立其名。青蓮那落迦中，由彼地極重廣大寒觸所觸，一切身分悉皆青瘀，皮膚破裂，或五或六。故此那落迦名曰青蓮。紅蓮那落迦與此差別。過此青已，色變紅赤，皮膚分裂或十或多。故此那落迦名曰紅蓮。大紅蓮那落迦與此差別。謂彼身分極大紅赤，皮膚分裂或百或多。故此那落迦名大紅蓮。
Furthermore, beings born in the cold hells (寒那落迦) endure extremely severe cold suffering. For those born in the Arbuda hell, they are afflicted by the intense, vast cold of that realm, causing all their body parts to contract and look like blisters, which is why this hell is named Arbuda (the blister hell). The Nirarbuda hell differs from this; it's like when blisters burst, oozing pus and blood, with the sores wrinkling. Thus, this hell is named Nirarbuda (burst blister).

The hells of Aṭaṭa, Hahava, and Huhuva derive their names from the distinct sounds of suffering made by the beings therein. In the Utpala (Blue Lotus) hell, due to the extreme and vast cold, all body parts turn blue and bruised, with the skin cracking open in five or six places, therefore it's named Utpala. The Padma (Red Lotus) hell differs from this; beyond the initial bluing, the skin turns red and splits in ten or more places, which is why it's named Padma. The Mahāpadma (Great Red Lotus) hell is distinct in that the body parts turn a deep red, with the skin splitting in a hundred or more places, hence it is named Mahāpadma.

又獨一那落迦中受生有情，各於自身自業所感，多受如是種種大苦。如吉祥問採菉豆子經中廣說。故此那落迦名為獨一。
Furthermore, beings born in the solitary hells (獨一那落迦) suffer various great pains individually, each according to their own actions and the karma they have accumulated. This is extensively discussed in the sūtras, such as in the questions of the auspicious being on gathering Udumbara flowers. Therefore, this hell is named "solitary" (獨一) because the suffering experienced there is specific to the karma of each individual being.

又傍生趣更相殘害，如羸弱者為諸強力之所殺害，由此因緣受種種苦。以不自在，他所驅馳，多被鞭撻，與彼人天為資生具。由此因緣具受種種極重苦惱。
Additionally, beings in the state of being born in parallel existences (傍生趣) inflict harm upon each other; for instance, the weak are killed by the strong, and due to this reason, they suffer various kinds of suffering. They are not free but are driven and controlled by others, often whipped and beaten, and are used by humans and gods as resources for livelihood. Because of these reasons, they endure various types of severe distress.

又餓鬼趣略有三種。一者、由外障礙飲食，二者、由內障礙飲食，三者、飲食無有障礙。云何由外障礙飲食？謂彼有情、由習上品慳故，生鬼趣中，常與飢渴相應。皮肉血脈皆悉枯槁，猶如火炭，頭髮蓬亂，其面黯黑，脣口乾焦，常以其舌舐略口面。飢渴慞惶，處處馳走。所到泉池，為餘有情手執刀杖及以羂索行列守護，令不得趣。或強趣之，便見其泉變成膿血，自不欲飲。如是等鬼，是名由外障礙飲食。云何由內障礙飲食？謂彼有情，口或如針，口或如炬，或復頸癭，其腹寬大。由此因緣，縱得飲食，無他障礙，自然不能若噉若飲。如是等鬼，是名由內障礙飲食。云何飲食無有障礙？謂有餓鬼，名猛焰鬘。隨所飲噉，皆被燒然。由此因緣，飢渴大苦未甞暫息。復有餓鬼，名食糞穢。或有一分食糞飲溺；或有一分唯能飲噉極可厭惡生熟臭穢，縱得香美而不能食。或有一分自割身肉而噉食之，縱得餘食，竟不能噉。如是等鬼，是名飲食無有障礙。
Furthermore, there are generally three types of hungry ghosts (餓鬼趣):

1. **Those obstructed from food and drink by external means:** This refers to beings who, due to their past habit of stinginess, are reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts and are constantly afflicted with hunger and thirst. Their skin, flesh, and blood vessels are all dried up, resembling charcoal. Their hair is disheveled, their faces are darkened, and their lips and mouths are parched, with their tongues constantly licking and grazing their lips and faces. Driven by panic from hunger and thirst, they run around. When they approach springs or ponds, they are driven away or guarded by other beings wielding knives, staffs, or lassos, making it impossible for them to approach. Or, if they forcibly approach, they see the water turn into pus and blood, which they naturally do not want to drink. Such ghosts are said to be obstructed from food and drink by external means.

2. **Those obstructed from food and drink by internal means:** This refers to beings whose mouths are as small as needles or torches, or who have goiters, with their stomachs enormously large. Due to this reason, even if food and drink are available without other obstructions, they naturally cannot chew or swallow. Such ghosts are said to be obstructed from food and drink by internal means.

3. **Those without obstructions to food and drink:** This refers to a type of hungry ghost known as "Fierce Flame Wreath." Whatever they eat or drink instantly burns up. Because of this, their suffering from hunger and thirst never ceases for even a moment. There are also hungry ghosts known as "Excrement Eaters." Some of them eat feces and drink urine; some exclusively consume the most repulsive raw or cooked filth, and even if presented with fragrant and delicious food, they are unable to eat it. Others cut off their own flesh to eat, unable to consume any other food even if available. Such ghosts are said to be without obstructions to food and drink.

又人趣中受生有情，多受如是匱乏之苦。所謂俱生飢渴匱乏苦；所欲不果匱乏苦；麁疎飲食匱乏苦；逼切追求攝受等匱乏苦；時節變異，若寒若熱匱乏苦；無有舍宅覆障，所作淋漏匱乏苦；黑闇等障，所作事業皆悉休廢匱乏苦。又受變壞老病死苦。由那落迦中謂死為樂，故於彼趣不立為苦。
Also, beings born into the human realm endure various types of scarcity and deprivation. These include:

1. The suffering of inherent hunger, thirst, and scarcity;
2. The suffering of not achieving what one desires, leading to scarcity;
3. The suffering of crude and coarse food and drink, contributing to scarcity;
4. The suffering of intense pursuit and acquisition efforts, resulting in scarcity;
5. The suffering due to changing seasons, such as cold and heat, creating scarcity;
6. The suffering of lacking shelter and protection, leading to exposure and scarcity;
7. The suffering of obstacles such as darkness, which halt all activities, causing scarcity.

Moreover, they experience the suffering of decay, illness, and death. However, in the hells, death is considered a relief, so within those realms, it is not defined as suffering.

又天趣中無解支節苦，而有死墮苦。如經中說：有諸天子將欲沒時，五相先現。一、衣無垢染，有垢染現；二、鬘舊不萎，今乃萎顇；三、兩腋汗流；四、身便臭穢；五、天及天子不樂本座。時彼天子偃臥林間，所有婇女與餘天子共為遊戲。彼既見已，由此因緣，生大憂苦。復受陵蔑悚慄之苦。所以者何？由有廣大福聚成就及廣大五欲天子生時，所餘薄福諸舊天子見已惶怖。由此因緣，受大憂苦。又受斫截破壞、驅擯殘害之苦。所以者何？由天與非天共戰諍時，天與非天互相違拒，即執四仗，所謂金、銀、頗胝、琉璃，共相戰鬪。爾時諸天及與非天，或斷支節，或破其身，或復致死。若傷身斷節，續還如故，若斷其首，即便殞沒。天與非天互有他勝，然天多勝，力勢強故。然其彼二，若為他勝，即退入自宮，己之同類竟不慰問。由此因緣，便懷憂慼。若天得勝，便入非天宮中，為悅其女，起此違諍；若非天得勝，即入天宮，為求四種蘇陀味故，共相戰諍。又諸非天，當知天趣所攝。然由意志多懷詐幻，諂誑多故，不如諸天為淨法器。由此因緣，有時經中說為別趣，實是天類。由不受行諸天法故，說為非天。復有強力天子，纔一發憤，諸劣天子便被驅擯，出其自宮。是故諸天受三種苦。謂死墮苦，陵蔑苦，斫截破壞、殘害驅擯苦。
Furthermore, in the realm of the gods, there is no suffering from the dislocation of joints, but there is the suffering from death and downfall. As stated in the sutras: When the gods are about to perish, five signs appear:
1. Garments that were previously stainless now show stains;
2. Flowers that were not wilting now droop;
3. Sweat flows from under their arms;
4. Their bodies emit an unpleasant odor;
5. They no longer enjoy sitting in their usual seats, and their fellow gods and goddesses no longer find pleasure in their company. At this time, the god lies down in a forest alone, while his consorts and other gods indulge in play without him. Seeing this, he experiences great suffering and fear. And he suffers from being derided and terrified. Why is this? Because when a god of great fortune and great pleasure is born, the older gods with lesser merit become fearful upon seeing him. For this reason, they experience great sorrow.

They also suffer from being cut, destroyed, driven away, and harmed. Why? Because when gods and anti-gods (demons) battle, they resist each other, wielding weapons made of gold, silver, vaidūrya, and crystal, fighting intensely. During these battles, gods and anti-gods may have their limbs severed, bodies broken, or even be killed. If a limb is severed, it can be restored, but if the head is severed, that results in instant death. Gods and anti-gods each may overcome the other, but gods often prevail due to their greater strength. However, when one side wins, the defeated retreat to their palaces without their peers offering any consolation, leading to deep distress. If the gods win, they enter the palaces of the anti-gods to delight in their women, which is one cause of conflict; if the anti-gods win, they enter the gods' palaces seeking the four kinds of heavenly nectar, leading to battles. It should be noted that anti-gods are also considered part of the heavenly realm. Because they are often engaged in deceit and flattery, they are not regarded as pure vessels for the Dharma like the gods are. For this reason, sometimes they are mentioned in the scriptures as a separate realm, but essentially they belong to the class of gods. Because they do not practice the Dharma of the gods, they are referred to as anti-gods.

Additionally, when a powerful god becomes resolute, the inferior gods are immediately driven away and expelled from their palaces. Thus, the gods suffer three types of suffering: the suffering from death and downfall, the suffering from being derided, and the suffering from being cut, destroyed, driven away, and harmed.

又色、無色界有情無有如是等苦，由彼有情非苦受器故。然由麁重苦故，說彼有苦。有煩惱故，有障礙故，於死及住不自在故。
Furthermore, sentient beings in the form and formless realms do not experience such suffering because they are not susceptible to painful sensations. However, it is said that they do experience suffering due to gross suffering, because of afflictions, obstacles, and discomfort during death and existence.

又無漏界中，一切麁重諸苦永斷。是故唯此是勝義樂，當知所餘一切是苦。
Moreover, within the realm of the undefiled (anāsrava-dhātu), all gross forms of suffering are forever severed. Therefore, only this state represents ultimate bliss, and it should be understood that all else is suffering.

又於四種那落迦中無有樂受。如那落迦中，三種餓鬼中亦爾。諸大力鬼、傍生、人中，有外門所生資具樂可得，然為眾苦之所相雜。
Also, within the four types of hell (naraka), there is no experience of pleasure. Similarly, within the three types of hungry ghosts, there is also no pleasure to be found. Among the powerful ghosts, beings born alongside humans, and among humans themselves, pleasures derived from external sources and possessions can be obtained. However, these are mixed with manifold sufferings.

又人趣中，轉輪王樂最勝微妙。由彼輪王出現世時，有成就七寶自然出現，故說彼王具足七寶。
Furthermore, within the human realm, the pleasure of a Chakravartin (wheel-turning king) is considered the most supreme and subtle. When such a king appears in the world, the accomplishment of the seven treasures naturally manifests. Therefore, it is said that this king possesses the seven treasures.

何等為七？所謂輪寶、象寶、馬寶、末尼珠寶、女寶、主藏臣寶、主兵臣寶。爾時輪寶等現，其相云何？七寶現相，如經廣說。
What are the seven (treasures)? They are known as the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and the Warrior Treasure. At the time when the Wheel Treasure and others manifest, what are their characteristics? The characteristics of the seven treasures are extensively described in the scriptures.

若彼輪王王四洲者，一切小王望風順化，各自白言：某城邑聚落，天之所有，唯願大王垂恩教勅，我等皆當為天僕隸。爾時輪王便即勅令：汝等諸王！各於自境以理獎化，當以如法，勿以非法。又復汝等於國於家勿行非法行，勿行不平等行。若彼輪王王三洲者，先遣使往，然後從化。
If such a wheel-turning king rules over the four continents, all the lesser kings adapt and comply at the mere sight of him, each declaring openly, "The towns, cities, and settlements in the heavens are all under your dominion, we only wish for Your Majesty to graciously decree, and we shall all serve as your subjects." At that time, the wheel-turning king immediately issues a decree, "You kings! Each within your own domains, guide your people with reason and uplift them. Ensure that justice is upheld, and refrain from any unlawful or unequal actions. Also, within your states and families, do not engage in illegitimate or unequal conduct." If the wheel-turning king rules over three continents, he first sends messengers, and then they are converted.

若彼輪王王二洲者，興師現威，後乃從化。若彼輪王王一洲者，便自往彼，奮戈揮刃，然後從化。
If the wheel-turning king rules over two continents, he musters his army and demonstrates his might, after which conversion follows. If the wheel-turning king rules just one continent, he himself goes there, brandishes his spear and wields his sword, and only then does conversion follow.

復次，諸天受其廣大天之富樂。形色殊妙，多諸適悅，於自宮中而得久住。其身內外皆悉清潔，無有臭穢。又人身內多有不淨，所謂塵垢筋骨脾腎心肝；彼皆無有。
Furthermore, the gods enjoy the vast wealth and pleasures of the heavens. Their forms and appearances are wonderfully distinctive, filled with various delights, allowing them to reside in their palaces for an extended period. Their bodies, both inside and out, are entirely clean, without any foul odor. In contrast, the human body internally harbors many impurities, such as dirt, sinews, bones, spleen, kidneys, heart, and liver; the gods are free from all these.

又彼諸天有四種宮殿，所謂金、銀、頗胝、琉璃所成，種種文綵綺飾莊嚴。種種臺閣、種種樓觀、種種層級、種種窓牖、種種羅網，皆可愛樂。種種末尼以為綺鈿，周匝放光，共相照曜。
Additionally, these heavenly beings possess four types of palaces, made of gold, silver, crystal, and lapis lazuli, adorned with various patterns and splendid decorations. There are various pavilions, towers, balconies, stairways, windows, and nettings, all of which are delightful and appealing. Various precious gems are used as inlays, radiating light all around and illuminating each other with their brilliance.

復有食樹，從其樹裏出四食味，名曰蘇陀，所謂青黃赤白。復有飲樹，從此流出甘美之飲。復有乘樹，從此出生種種妙乘，所謂車輅輦輿等。復有衣樹，從此出生種種妙衣，其衣細軟，妙色鮮潔，雜綵間飾。復有莊嚴具樹，從此出生種種微妙莊嚴之具，所謂末尼、臂印、耳璫、環釧，及以手足綺飾之具。如是等類諸莊嚴具，皆以種種妙末尼寶而間飾之。復有熏香鬘樹，從此出生種種塗香、種種熏香、種種花鬘。復有大集會樹，最勝微妙。其根深固五十踰繕那，其身高挺百踰繕那，枝條及葉遍覆八十踰繕那；雜花開發，其香順風熏百踰繕那，逆風熏五十踰繕那。於此樹下，三十三天雨四月中，以天妙五欲共相娛樂。復有歌笑舞樂之樹，從此出生歌笑舞等種種樂器。
Moreover, there are food trees, from which emerge four kinds of flavors, known as Suddha, namely green, yellow, red, and white. There are also drink trees, from which flows delicious beverages. Additionally, there are vehicle trees, producing various wonderful means of transport, such as chariots, coaches, and palanquins, etc. There are clothing trees as well, yielding various splendid garments, which are fine, soft, beautifully colored, bright, and adorned with mixed patterns.

Furthermore, there are ornamentation trees, producing various exquisite items for adornment, such as jewels, armlets, earrings, bracelets, and other decorative items for hands and feet. Such types of ornamental items are all embellished with various wonderful jewels.

There are also fragrance and garland trees, from which arise various anointing fragrances, various perfumes, and various flower garlands.

There is the Great Assembly Tree, supreme and wonderful. Its roots are deeply set fifty yojanas down, its trunk rises a hundred yojanas high, and its branches and leaves cover an area of eighty yojanas; when its mixed flowers bloom, their fragrance spreads a hundred yojanas with the wind and fifty yojanas against it. Under this tree, throughout the four months of rain, the gods of the Thirty-Three heavens partake in the heavenly pleasures of the five senses and entertain each other.

Additionally, there are trees for singing, laughter, dancing, and music, from which arise varieties of musical instruments for songs, laughter, dances, and the like

又有資具之樹，從此出生種種資具，所謂食飲之具、坐臥之具、如是等類種種資具。又彼諸天欲受用時，隨欲隨業，應其所須，來現手中。
Moreover, there are utilities trees, from which arise various types of utilities, such as utensils for eating and drinking, furnishings for sitting and sleeping, and other such kinds of utilities. Additionally, when these heavenly beings wish to enjoy these things, whatever they desire and according to their karma, whatever is needed appears in their hands as required

又諸非天，隨其所應，受用種種宮殿富樂應知。又北拘盧洲有如是相樹，名曰如意。彼諸人眾所欲資具，從樹而取。不由思惟，隨其所須，自然在手。復有秔稻，不種而穫。無有我所。又彼有情竟無繫屬、決定勝進。
Moreover, the asuras, according to their due, enjoy various palatial riches and pleasures. Additionally, in the northern continent of Uttarakuru, there exists a similar tree known as Wish-Fulfilling Tree. Whatever utilities and objects the people there desire, they obtain from the tree. Without the need for contemplation, whatever they need naturally appears in their hands. There also exists rice that does not require planting to harvest; it belongs to no one in particular. Furthermore, those beings ultimately have no attachments or fixed advancements.

又天帝釋有普勝殿，於諸殿中最為殊勝。仍於其處有百樓觀，一一樓觀有百臺閣，一一臺閣有七房室，一一房室有七天女，一一天女有七侍女。
Furthermore, the heavenly king Indra possesses a palace called the Sudarśana, which is the most marvelous among all palaces. At that site, there are a hundred towers, and each tower has a hundred pavilions. Each pavilion contains seven chambers, and each chamber is attended by seven celestial nymphs, with each nymph having seven maidens.

又彼諸天所有地界，平正如掌，竟無高下。履觸之時，便生安樂，下足之時，陷便至膝，舉足之時，隨足還起。於一切時，自然而有曼陀羅華遍布其上。時有微風吹去萎華，復引新者。
Additionally, the realms where these celestial beings reside are as flat and even as the palm of a hand, completely lacking any high or low areas. When they step on the ground, it brings forth comfort and pleasure; placing a foot down, one sinks to the knee, and lifting the foot, the ground naturally rises back. At all times, there are mandārava flowers naturally spread all over it. Occasionally, a gentle breeze blows away the withered flowers and brings forth new ones.

又彼天宮四面各有大街。其形殊妙，軌式可觀，清淨端嚴，度量齊整。復於四面有四大門，規模宏壯，色相希奇，觀之無厭，實為殊絕。多有異類妙色藥叉常所守護。
Additionally, each of the celestial palaces is surrounded by grand avenues on all four sides. Their appearance is wonderfully unique, with a layout that is remarkable, clean, dignified, and uniformly proportioned. On the four sides, there are four great gates, which are grand in scale, with rare and extraordinary colors and aspects that are endlessly fascinating and truly exceptional. Many different types of marvelous Yakṣas are always guarding them.

復於四面有四園苑：一名繢車，二名麁澁，三名和雜，四名喜林。其四園外有四勝地，色相殊妙，形狀可觀，端嚴無比。其宮東北隅，有天會處，名曰善法。
Furthermore, on the four sides, there are four gardens: the first is named Huāchē (Flower Chariot), the second is named Cūsè (Coarse and Rough), the third is named Hézā (Mixed and Blended), and the fourth is named Xǐlín (Joy Forest). Outside these four gardens are four exquisite grounds, with colors and appearances that are wonderfully unique, shapes that are striking, and an unmatched dignified elegance.

In the northeastern corner of the palace, there is a celestial assembly place named Shanfǎ (Good Dharma)

諸天入中，思惟、稱量、觀察妙義。近此園側，有如意石，其色黃白，形質殊妙，其相可觀，嚴麗無比。
When the celestial beings enter this place, they contemplate, evaluate, and examine profound meanings. Near this garden, there is a wish-fulfilling stone, its color yellow-white. Its form and substance are wonderfully unique, its appearance is striking, and its elegance is unparalleled.

又彼天身自然光曜。闇相若現，乃知晝去夜分方來。便於天妙五欲遊戲之中，嬾墮睡眠。異類之鳥不復和鳴。由此等相以表晝夜。又彼諸天眾妙五欲甚可愛樂，唯發喜樂。彼諸天眾恒為放逸之所持行。常聞種種歌舞音樂鼓噪之聲，調戲言笑談謔等聲。常見種種可意之色。常齅種種微妙之香，恒甞種種美好之味。恒觸種種天諸婇女最勝之觸。恒為是樂牽引其意，以度其時。
Furthermore, the bodies of these celestial beings naturally radiate light. When darkness appears, it is then known that day has passed and night is approaching. On such occasions, they indulge in the delightful entertainments of the five heavenly desires and succumb to laziness, falling into sleep. The birds of different kinds no longer sing harmoniously. Through these signs, the distinction between day and night is indicated.

Moreover, the celestial beings' engagement with the marvelous five desires is extremely delightful and joyful. The celestial assemblies are constantly carried away by indulgence. They are always surrounded by the sounds of various songs, dances, music, and uproarious celebrations, along with teasing, laughter, joking, and playful conversations. They are constantly seeing various pleasing forms and colors. They perpetually inhale various exquisite fragrances and constantly taste various delicious flavors. They are endlessly experiencing the most superior tactile sensations from contact with celestial women. Constantly drawn by these pleasures, they let their minds be led by them, passing their time in that manner.

又彼諸天多受如是眾妙欲樂，常無疾病，亦無衰老，無飲食等匱乏所作俱生之苦，無如前說於人趣中有餘匱乏之苦。
Additionally, these celestial beings frequently indulge in such manifold wonderful pleasures. They are always free from illness and do not age. They neither suffer from the scarcity associated with lack of food and drink nor from any of the other forms of deprivation mentioned previously that afflict beings in the human realm.
