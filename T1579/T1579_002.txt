Tell me what division/section this is, any titles or sections, and briefly summarize this juan **only** of the chinese Yogacarabhumisastra, providing your answer in english noting translations. No need to summarize the treatise in general, just this juan.
The text provided is from the *Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra*, specifically Volume 2. This detailed exposition covers a wide range of doctrinal positions and practices related to the Yogācāra tradition of Buddhism, spoken by Maitreya Bodhisattva and translated into Chinese by the venerable Xuanzang. The discourse delves into deep metaphysical and psychological doctrines within the Yogācāra school, focusing on such aspects as consciousness, seeds of karma (*bīja*), and the process of birth and rebirth across different realms of existence.

**Main Topics Covered:**

1. **Seeds of Consciousness**: Discussion on how consciousness seeds (*bīja*) pertain to parinirvāṇa and how various types of seeds, including those of bodhi, exist or are lacked depending on one's spiritual state.

2. **Realms of Existence**: Examination of how different realms (desire, form, formless) contain the seeds of one another, implying the interconnection and potentiality present within sentient beings to experience these realms.

3. **Growth and Transformation**: The process of embryonic development, mentioning stages such as *kalala* along with the influence of elements (earth, wind, fire, water), is explored to explain physical and spiritual development.

4. **Karma and Rebirth**: Insights into how actions (pure and impure) affect rebirth, life experiences, and spiritual growth. Discourse on avoidance of ego (self and mine) and recognition of suffering.

5. **Psychophysical Development**: Descriptions of how sentient beings develop in the womb, experience suffering, and undergo transformation leading to rebirth in various realms.

6. **Formation and Destruction of Worlds**: Cosmic cycles of creation and destruction are reflected upon, detailing processes leading to the formation of physical and sentient aspects of existence, including the arising and subsiding of realms over kalpas.

7. **Ethical and Spiritual Praxis**: Guidance on virtuous conduct, fostering renunciation, engaging in wholesome actions, and the pursuit of enlightenment by understanding and overcoming the cyclic existence (*saṃsāra*).

8. **Living Beings and Socio-Cosmic Order**: The structured division of sentient beings into classes and realms, societal roles, and existential stages underline the complex cosmological and social vision of reality as observed in Yogācāra Buddhism.

By analyzing consciousness, karmic causality, development through life cycles, and the cosmological scale of existence, Volume 2 of the *Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra* reveals profound insights into the nature of reality, suffering, liberation, and the path towards enlightenment. The teachings emphasize the intricacy of the mind and phenomena, urging practitioners towards a deeper understanding and realization of the Buddhadharma for ultimate freedom from the cycle of birth and death.

本地分中意地第二之二
In the fundamental section, the second of the mano-bhūmi, part two

復次，此一切種子識，若般涅槃法者，一切種子皆悉具足。不般涅槃法者，便闕三種菩提種子。隨所生處，自體之中，餘體種子皆悉隨逐。
Furthermore, all these seeds of consciousness, if pertaining to the dharma of parinirvāṇa, all seeds are entirely complete. For those not pertaining to the dharma of parinirvāṇa, then three types of bodhi seeds are missing. Depending on the place of birth, within one's own essence, the seeds of other essences all follow accordingly.

是故欲界自體中，亦有色、無色界一切種子。如是色界自體中，亦有欲、無色界一切種子。無色界自體中，亦有欲、色界一切種子。
Therefore, within the essence of the desire realm, there are also all seeds of the form and formless realms. Likewise, within the essence of the form realm, there are also all seeds of the desire and formless realms. Within the essence of the formless realm, there are also all seeds of the desire and form realms.

又羯羅藍漸增長時，名之與色平等增長，俱漸廣大。如是增長，乃至依止圓滿應知。此中由地界故，依止造色漸漸增廣。由水界故，攝持不散。由火界故，成熟堅鞕。由無潤故，由風界故，分別肢節各安其所。
Furthermore, as the kalala gradually grows, its name and form increase equally, both gradually expanding. Such growth, until the reliance is fully perfected, should be understood. Within this, due to the earth element, the reliant form gradually expands. Due to the water element, it is cohesively held together. Due to the fire element, it matures and solidifies. Due to the absence of moisture, and by the air element, the limbs differentiate and each finds its place.

又一切種子識，於生自體雖有淨不淨業因，然唯樂著戲論為最勝因。於生族姓、色力、壽量、資具等果，即淨不淨業為最勝因。
Furthermore, all these seeds of consciousness, although having causes of pure and impure actions in generating their own essence, it is delight, attachment, and discourse that are the supreme causes. In generating results such as lineage, complexion, strength, lifespan, and provisions, indeed, the pure and impure actions are the supreme causes.

又諸凡夫，於自體上計我、我所，及起我慢。一切聖者，觀唯是苦。
Furthermore, all ordinary beings impute 'I' and 'mine' upon their own essence, and arouse egoistic pride. All sages, conversely, perceive it solely as suffering.

又處胎分中，有自性受，不苦不樂，依識增長。唯此性受，異熟所攝。餘一切受，或異熟所生，或境界緣生。又苦受、樂受，或於一時從緣現起，或時不起。
Furthermore, within the stage of the embryo, there is an intrinsic feeling that is neither suffering nor joy, growing in accordance with consciousness. This very nature of feeling is encompassed by ripened karma. All other feelings are either born of ripened karma or arise due to conditions related to objects. Moreover, feelings of suffering and joy may either manifest concurrently from conditions at a given moment or may not manifest at all.

又種子體，無始時來相續不絕。性雖無始有之，然由淨不淨業差別熏發，望數數取異熟果，說彼為新。若果已生，說此種子為已受果。由此道理，生死流轉相續不絕，乃至未般涅槃。又諸種子未與果者，或順生受，或順後受。雖經百千劫，從自種子一切自體復圓滿生。
Moreover, the essence of seeds has been continuous without break from beginningless time. Although their existence is without beginning, due to the influence and cultivation by pure and impure actions, when viewed in terms of repeatedly obtaining ripened fruits, they are considered new. If the fruit has already arisen, then that seed is regarded as having experienced its result. Based on this principle, the cycle of birth and death perpetuates without end, until nirvāṇa is not attained. Also, all seeds not yet encountered with their results may comply with experiencing results either in this life or in subsequent lives. Even after hundreds of thousands of eons, from their own seeds, all essences once again fully manifest.

雖餘果生要由自種，若至壽量盡邊，爾時此種名已受果。所餘自體種子未與果故，不名已受果。又諸種子，即於此身中應受異熟，緣差不受。順不定受攝故。然此種子亦唯住此位。是故一一自體中，皆有一切自體種子。
Though the birth of other fruits requires their own seeds, if one reaches the edge of their lifespan, then at that moment, this seed is considered to have experienced its result. The remaining seeds of one's own essence, not yet encountering their fruits, are not considered to have experienced results. Moreover, all seeds, which should receive their ripened effects within this body, may not due to differences in conditions, falling under the category of uncertain reception. Yet, these seeds also merely remain in this state. Thus, within each individual essence, all seeds of that very essence are present.

若於一處有染欲，即說一切處有染欲。若於一處得離欲，即說於一切處得離欲。
If in one aspect there exists defiled desire, it is declared that in all aspects defiled desire exists. If in one aspect liberation from desire is attained, it is declared that liberation from desire is attained in all aspects.

又於諸自體中所有種子，若煩惱品所攝，名為麁重，亦名隨眠。若異熟品所攝，及餘無記品所攝，唯名麁重，不名隨眠。若信等善法品所攝種子，不名麁重，亦非隨眠。何以故？由此法生時，所依自體唯有堪能，非不堪能。是故一切所依自體，麁重所隨故，麁重所生故，麁重自性故，諸佛如來安立為苦，所謂由行苦故。
Moreover, among all seeds within each essence, those encompassed by the category of afflictions are termed as coarse and also referred to as latent inclinations. If covered by the category of ripened results, as well as other unconditioned categories, they are merely termed as coarse, not as latent inclinations. Seeds within the category of wholesome dharmas, such as faith, are not considered coarse, nor are they latent inclinations. Why so? Because when these dharmas arise, the essence they depend upon only possesses capability, not incapability. Therefore, in every essence relied upon, due to being associated with coarseness, arising from coarseness, and due to the inherent coarseness, all Buddhas and Tathāgatas have established them as suffering, which is termed as suffering due to conditioned phenomena.

又諸種子，乃有多種差別之名。所謂名界、名種姓，名自性，名因，名薩迦耶，名戲論，名阿賴耶，名取，名苦，名薩迦耶見所依止處，名我慢所依止處。如是等類，差別應知。
Moreover, among all seeds within each essence, those encompassed by the category of afflictions are termed as coarse and also referred to as latent inclinations.

Seeds within the category of wholesome dharmas, such as faith, are not considered coarse, nor are they latent inclinations. Why so?

Therefore, in every essence relied upon, due to being associated with coarseness, arising from coarseness, and due to the inherent coarseness, all Buddhas and Tathāgatas have established them as suffering, which is termed as suffering due to conditioned phenomena.

又般涅槃時，已得轉依諸淨行者，轉捨一切染污法種子所依。於一切善、無記法種子，轉令緣闕，轉得內緣自在。
Furthermore, during nirvāṇa, those who have achieved transformation and rely on pure practices abandon the basis of all seeds of defiled dharmas. They cause the conditions for all wholesome and unconditioned dharmas' seeds to be absent, thereby achieving inner freedom and autonomy over conditions.

又於胎中，經三十八七日，此之胎藏，一切支分皆悉具足。從此已後、復經四日方乃出生。如薄伽梵於入胎經廣說。此說極滿足者，或經九月、或復過此。若唯經八月，此名圓滿，非極圓滿。若經七月、六月，不名圓滿，或復缺減。
Furthermore, within the womb, after three hundred and eighty-seven days, the fetus has all its limbs fully developed. Following this, after an additional four days, the birth takes place. As is extensively explained in the Buddha's discourse on conception. The condition of being fully formed, sometimes occurs after nine months or may even exceed this duration. If it occurs over eight months, this is termed as complete, yet not utmost complete. If occurring over seven or six months, it is not regarded as complete, or may be seen as reduced.

又此胎藏六處位中，由母所食生麁津味而得資長。於羯羅藍等微細位中，由微細津味資長應知。
Moreover, within the fetal stage of the six locations, it is nourished and grows through the coarse essence of flavors derived from the mother's consumption. In the stages of kalala and other subtle states, it should be understood to grow through the subtle essence of flavors.

復次，此之胎藏，八位差別。何等為八？謂羯羅藍位、遏部曇位、閉尸位、鍵南位、鉢羅賒佉位、髮毛爪位、根位、形位。若已結凝，箭內仍稀，名羯羅藍。若表裏如酪，未至肉位，名遏部曇。若已成肉，仍極柔軟，名閉尸。若已堅厚，稍堪摩觸，名為鍵南。即此肉摶增長，支分相現，名鉢羅賒佉。從此以後，髮毛爪現，即名此位。從此以後，眼等根生，名為根位。從此以後，彼所依處分明顯現，名為形位。

又於胎藏中，或由先業力，或由其母不避不平等力所生隨順風故，令此胎藏或髮、或色、或皮及餘支分變異而生。
Furthermore, in the fetal stage within the six locations, growth is sustained through the coarse essences derived from what the mother consumes. During the stages of the kalala and other fine stages, growth is sustained by the subtle essences, it should be understood.

髮變異生者，謂由先世所作能感此惡不善業，及由其母多習灰鹽等味若飲、若食，令此胎藏髮毛稀尠。
Those born with abnormal hair are considered to be so due to the unwholesome actions committed in previous lives that have the capacity to cause this effect, as well as due to their mothers frequently indulging in flavors such as ashes and salt, whether through drinking or eating, leading to the fetus developing sparse hair.

色變異生者，謂由先業因，如前說，及由其母習近煖熱現在緣故，令彼胎藏黑黯色生。又母習近極寒室等，令彼胎藏極白色生。又由其母多噉熱食，令彼胎藏極赤色生。
Those born with unusual skin color are said to be so due to causes from previous actions, as previously mentioned, and also because of their mother's habitual exposure to warmth and heat, resulting in the fetus developing a dark complexion. Additionally, the mother being habitually exposed to extreme cold environments causes the fetus to develop an extremely pale complexion. Furthermore, the mother’s frequent consumption of hot food causes the fetus to develop an extremely red complexion.

皮變異生者，謂由宿業因，如前說，及由其母多習婬欲現在緣故，令彼胎藏或癬、疥、癩等惡皮而生。
Those born with abnormal skin conditions are said to be influenced by causes from past actions, as previously mentioned, and also due to their mother's frequent indulgence in licentious desires, leading to the fetus developing skin diseases such as scabies, mange, leprosy, and other such conditions.

支分變異生者，謂由先業因，如前說，及由其母多習馳走、跳躑威儀，及不避不平等現在緣故，令彼胎藏諸根支分缺減而生。
Those born with abnormalities in limbs or organs are attributed to causes from past actions, as previously mentioned, and also due to their mothers frequently engaging in running, jumping, and imposing postures, as well as not avoiding uneven terrains, leading to the fetus developing with diminished or deficient limbs or organs.

又彼胎藏，若當為女，於母左脇，倚脊向腹而住。若當為男，於母右脇，倚腹向脊而住。
Furthermore, if the fetus is to be female, it resides under the mother's left rib, leaning against the spine and facing the abdomen. If the fetus is to be male, it resides under the mother's right rib, leaning against the abdomen and facing the spine.

又此胎藏極成滿時，其母不堪持此重胎，內風便發，生大苦惱。
Moreover, when the fetus reaches the peak of its development, the mother cannot bear the weight of this heavy fetus, causing internal winds to rise and leading to great discomfort.

又此胎藏業報所發生分風起，令頭向下、足便向上，胎衣纏裹而趣產門。其正出時，胎衣遂裂，分之兩腋。出產門時，名正生位。生後漸次觸生分觸，所謂眼觸乃至意觸。次復隨墮施設事中，所謂隨學世事言說。次復耽著家室，謂長大種類故，諸根成就故。次造諸業，謂起世間工巧業處。次復受用境界，所謂色等若可愛、不可愛。受此苦樂，謂由先業因，或由現在緣。隨緣所牽，或往五趣，或向涅槃。
Moreover, when the fetus reaches its full development due to the karma-induced emergence of winds, it aligns with the head down and feet up, wrapped by the amniotic sac and moving towards the birth canal. When it properly exits, the amniotic sac breaks at the sides. Exiting through the birth canal is designated as the correct birthing position. Following birth, gradual sensations of contact emerge, referred to as eye contact up to mental contact. Then, according to habituation, they engage in worldly interactions, known as learning worldly speech and matters. Subsequently, they indulge in family life, due to growth and the completion of the senses. They then create various actions, involving in worldly crafts and occupations. Next, they encounter objects of the senses, identified as either desirable or undesirable. Experiencing these pleasures and sufferings is attributed to causes from past actions or present circumstances. Driven by these conditions, one may proceed to the five realms or towards nirvāṇa.

又諸有情，隨於如是有情類中自體生時，彼有情類於此有情作四種緣。謂種子所引故，食所資養故，隨逐守護故，隨學造作身語業故。初謂父母精血所引。
Moreover, when sentient beings are born within such categories of sentient beings, their category offers four kinds of conditions to the newborn being. These include the attraction by seeds, nourishment through food, following and protection, and the imitation and creation of physical and verbal actions. The initial is referred to as being attracted by the essence and blood of the parents.

次彼生已，知其所欲，方求飲食而用資長。次常隨逐，專志守護，不令起作非時之行及不平等行。次令習學世俗言說等事。由長大種類故，諸根成就故，此復於餘，此復於餘。
After its birth, recognizing its needs, it then seeks nourishment through food and drink for growth. Following this, there is consistent attention and dedicated protection, preventing engagement in untimely and uneven actions. Subsequently, it is taught to learn and engage in worldly speech and activities. As a result of growing up and the development of the senses, and then further in interactions with others, and once more in interactions with others.

如是展轉，諸有情類無始時來受苦受樂，未曾獲得出苦樂法，乃至諸佛未證菩提。若從他聞音，及內正思惟，由如是故，方得漏盡。如是句義甚為難悟。謂我無有若分、若誰、若事，我亦都非若分、若誰、若事。
In such cycles of transmigration, sentient beings have been experiencing suffering and pleasure since beginningless time, never having achieved the means to escape from suffering and pleasure, until the Buddhas attained Bodhi. If one hears teachings from others and engages in correct internal contemplation, it is through such means that they eventually attain the cessation of defilements. The significance of this phrase is exceedingly difficult to understand. It denotes that there is no 'I', neither in parts, nor in identity, nor in affairs; similarly, 'I' am not any part, any identity, or any affair.

如是略說內分死生已。
Thus, the inner aspect of birth and death has been briefly explained.

云何外分若壞若成？謂由諸有情所作能感成壞業故。
What constitutes the external aspects of deterioration and formation? It refers to the actions performed by sentient beings that can induce creation and destruction.

若有能感壞業現前，爾時便有外壞緣起，由彼外分皆悉散壞，非如內分由壽量盡。何以故？由一切外分所有麁色，四大所成，恒相續住，非如內分。又感成器世間業，此業決定能引劫住，不增不減。若有情數，時無決定。所以者何？由彼造作種種業故，或過一劫，或復減少乃至一歲。
If actions capable of causing destruction manifest, then external causes of destruction come into being at that time, leading to the dispersal and collapse of all external aspects, unlike the internal aspect where cessation is due to the end of lifespan. Why is this so? Because all coarse physical forms in the external domain are constituted by the four great elements, persistently existing in sequence, unlike the internal aspect. Additionally, actions that bring about the formation of the material world definitively attract the period to persist without increase or decrease. The quantity of sentient beings, on the other hand, is not fixed. Why? Because of their varied actions, leading, in some instances, to exceeding an epoch or even reducing to as little as one year.

又彼壞劫。由三種災。一者、火災，能壞世間，從無間獄乃至梵世。二者、水災，能壞一切，乃至第二靜慮。三者、風災，能壞一切、乃至第三靜慮。第四靜慮無災能壞。由彼諸天身與宮殿俱生俱沒故，更無能壞因緣法故。復有三災之頂。謂第二靜慮、第三靜慮、第四靜慮。
Furthermore, the cataclysmic eras are subject to three types of disasters. First, fire disasters are capable of destroying realms from Avīci Hell up to the Brahma realm. Second, water disasters can obliterate all up to the second dhyāna. Third, wind disasters have the capacity to annihilate all up to the third dhyāna. The fourth dhyāna is not affected by such calamities. This is because the bodies of deities and their palaces within these realms are born and cease together, thus lacking any causes or conditions for their destruction. Additionally, there are peaks of these three disasters, namely, the second dhyāna, the third dhyāna, and the fourth dhyāna.

又此世間二十中劫壞，二十中劫壞已空，二十中劫成，二十中劫成已住；如是八十中劫，假立為一大劫數。又梵世間壽量一劫，此最後壞，亦最初成。當知此劫異相建立。謂梵眾天，二十中劫合為一劫，即依此劫施設壽量。
Moreover, this world goes through destruction in twenty intermediate kalpas, then remains empty for twenty intermediate kalpas, is formed over twenty intermediate kalpas, and exists for twenty intermediate kalpas after formation; thus, these eighty intermediate kalpas are provisionally constituted as one great kalpa. Additionally, the lifespan in the Brahma realms spans one kalpa, with this realm being the last to undergo destruction and likewise the first to emerge. This establishment of the kalpa's distinct characteristics should be recognized. It means that for the assembly of deities in the Brahma realm, twenty intermediate kalpas are combined to form one kalpa, and it is based on this kalpa that their lifespans are determined.

梵前益天，四十中劫合為一劫，即依此劫施設壽量。若大梵天，六十中劫合為一劫，即依此劫施設壽量。
Moreover, this world goes through destruction in twenty intermediate kalpas, then remains empty for twenty intermediate kalpas, is formed over twenty intermediate kalpas, and exists for twenty intermediate kalpas after formation; thus, these eighty intermediate kalpas are provisionally constituted as one great kalpa. Additionally, the lifespan in the Brahma realms spans one kalpa, with this realm being the last to undergo destruction and likewise the first to emerge. This establishment of the kalpa's distinct characteristics should be recognized. It means that for the assembly of deities in the Brahma realm, twenty intermediate kalpas are combined to form one kalpa, and it is based on this kalpa that their lifespans are determined.

云何火災能壞世間？
How is a fire disaster capable of destroying the world?

謂有如是時，世間有情壽量無限。從此漸減，乃至壽量經八萬歲。彼復受行不善法故，壽量轉減，乃至十歲。彼復獲得厭離之心，受行善法，由此因緣，壽量漸增，乃至八萬。如是壽量一減一增，合成一中劫。
It is said that at such a time, the lifespan of sentient beings in the world is limitless. From there, it gradually decreases, until lifespans last for eighty thousand years. Due to engaging in unwholesome actions again, their lifespans further decrease, down to ten years. Then, acquiring a mind of renunciation and engaging in wholesome actions, through these causes and conditions, lifespans gradually increase again to eighty thousand years. Thus, the decrease and increase in lifespan constitute one intermediate kalpa.

又此中劫，復有三種小災出現。謂儉、病、刀。儉災者，所謂人壽三十歲時，方始建立。當爾之時，精妙飲食不可復得，唯煎煮朽骨共為讌會。若遇得一粒稻、麥、粟、稗等子，重若末尼，藏置箱篋而守護之。
Furthermore, within this intermediate kalpa, three types of minor calamities appear, namely famine, illness, and conflict. The famine calamity is such that it is said to commence when human lifespans are at thirty years. At that time, fine foods and drinks become unattainable, with only the boiling of decayed bones used for communal meals. Should one find a single grain of rice, wheat, barley, or millet, valued as heavily as a gem, it is kept in boxes or chests and protected.

彼諸有情多無氣勢，蹎僵在地不復能起。由此飢儉，有情之類亡沒殆盡。此之儉災經七年七月七日七夜，方乃得過。
These sentient beings, most of whom lack strength, fall down stiff to the ground, unable to get up again. Because of this famine, the class of sentient beings nearly perishes entirely. This famine disaster lasts for seven years, seven months, seven days, and seven nights before it finally ends.

彼諸有情復共聚集，起下厭離。由此因緣，壽不退減，儉災遂息。
Those sentient beings then gather together again, developing a sense of renunciation. Due to these causes and conditions, their lifespans do not decrease further, and the famine disaster thus subsides.

又若人壽二十歲時，本起厭患今乃退捨。爾時多有疫氣、障癘、災橫、熱惱相續而生。彼諸有情遇此諸病，多悉殞沒。如是病災經七月七日七夜，方乃得過。
Additionally, when human lifespans reach twenty years, the previously arisen aversion to affliction is now relinquished. At that time, there is a prevalence of epidemic vapors, obstructions, calamities, and continuous fevers. Those sentient beings faced with these illnesses largely succumb and die. This illness calamity endures for seven months, seven days, and seven nights before it ultimately ends.

彼諸有情復共聚集，起中厭離。由此因緣，壽量無減，病災乃息。
Those sentient beings then come together once more, initiating an intermediate sense of renunciation. Because of these causes and conditions, their lifespans do not diminish further, and the illness disaster thus subsides.

又人壽十歲時，本起厭患今還退捨。爾時有情展轉相見，各起猛利殺害之心。由此因緣，隨執草木及以瓦石，皆成最極銳利刀劍，更相殘害，死喪略盡。如是刀災極經七日，方乃得過。
Moreover, when human lifespans are at ten years, the initial aversion to troubles is once again cast aside. At that time, sentient beings, upon encountering each other, each foster a fierce intention to commit harm. Because of these causes and conditions, even clutching at grass, wood, or wielding tiles and rocks, all become extremely sharp like swords and knives, leading to mutual destruction, with nearly all perishing. This catastrophe of conflict endures for precisely seven days before it eventually subsides.

爾時有情復有三種最極衰損。謂壽量衰損、依止衰損、資具衰損。壽量衰損者，所謂壽量極至十歲。依止衰損者，謂其身量極至一搩，或復一握。資具衰損者，爾時有情唯以粟稗為食中第一，以髮毼為衣中第一，以鐵為莊嚴中第一。五種上味悉皆隱沒，所謂酥、蜜、油、鹽等味，及甘蔗變味。
At that time, sentient beings experience three types of extreme decline: lifespan decline, dependence decline, and provisions decline. Lifespan decline refers to lifespans being reduced to just ten years. Dependence decline means their body size is reduced to merely a span or even a handful. Provisions decline indicates that at that time, sentient beings consider millet and wild grass as the foremost among foods, animal hide as the best clothing, and iron as the prime ornament. The five superior flavors are entirely concealed, namely the flavors of butter, honey, oil, salt, etc., and even sugarcane changes its taste.

爾時有情展轉聚集，起上厭離，不復退減。
At that time, sentient beings successively come together, fostering an elevated sense of renunciation, no longer declining.

又能棄捨損減壽量惡不善法，受行增長壽量善法，由此因緣，壽量、色力、富樂、自在皆漸增長，乃至壽量經八萬歲。
Furthermore, by discarding actions that reduce lifespan and engaging in virtuous actions that contribute to lifespan extension, due to these causes and conditions, lifespan, vitality, prosperity, joy, and freedom all gradually enhance, reaching up to eighty thousand years.

如是二十減、二十增，合四十增減，便出住劫。
Thus, twenty cycles of decrease and twenty cycles of increase, combining forty cycles of growth and decline, then emerge as the residing kalpa.

於最後增已，爾時那落迦有情唯沒不生。如是漸漸乃至沒盡，當知說名那落迦世間壞。如那落迦壞，傍生、餓鬼壞亦如是。
Upon the completion of the last increase, at that time, the beings in the Avīci Hell simply cease to be born. Gradually, they dwindle until completely extinguished. This is known as the destruction of the Avīci Hell realm. Similar to the destruction of Avīci, the realms of adjacent births and hungry ghosts also undergo similar destruction.

爾時人中隨一有情，自然法爾所得第二靜慮。其餘有情展轉隨學，亦復如是。皆此沒已，生極淨光天眾同分中。當知爾時說名人世間壞。
At that time, among humans, any one sentient being naturally attains the second dhyāna according to natural law. The remaining sentient beings, in turn, follow suit in learning and achieve similarly. Once all have thus ceased, they are reborn in the realm of utmost purity and light, among beings of similar status. It should be recognized that at this point, it is declared as the destruction of the human realm.

如人趣既爾，天趣亦然。當於此時，五趣世間居住之處無一有情可得，所有資具亦不可得。非唯資具不可復得，爾時天雨亦不可得。由無雨故，大地所有藥草叢林皆悉枯槁。復由無雨之所攝故，令此日輪熱勢增大。又諸有情能感壞劫業增上力故，及依六種所燒事故，復有六日輪漸次而現。彼諸日輪望舊日輪所有熱勢，踰前四倍。既成七已，熱遂增七。
As with the human realm, so it is with the celestial realm. At this time, none of the sentient beings from the five realms of existence can be found, and all forms of provisions are also unobtainable. Not only are provisions unavailable, but rain from the heavens as well becomes unattainable. Due to the lack of rain, all the medicinal herbs and forests on the earth dry up and wither. Additionally, because of the absence of rain, the heat from the sun intensifies. Also, because of the augmented force of karma from sentient beings that brings about the cataclysmic epoch, along with the burning caused by six types of fires, six more suns begin to appear sequentially. The heat from these additional suns, in comparison to the original sun, is quadrupled. When seven are complete, the heat thus increases sevenfold.

云何名為六所燒事？一、小大溝坑，由第二日輪之所枯竭；二、小河大河，由第三日輪之所枯竭；三、無熱大池、由第四日輪之所枯竭；四者、大海，由第五日輪及第六一分之所枯竭；五、蘇迷盧山及以大地，體堅實故，由第六一分及第七日輪之所燒然。即此火焰為風所鼓，展轉熾盛、極至梵世。
What constitutes the six types of fires? 1) Small and large ditches and pits, exhausted by the second sun; 2) Small rivers and great rivers, exhausted by the third sun; 3) The cool grand pools, exhausted by the fourth sun; 4) The great ocean, drained by the fifth sun and a fraction of the sixth; 5) Sumeru Mountain and the solid earth, due to their firmness, are ignited by a fraction of the sixth and the seventh sun. Then, these flames, fanned by the wind, spread increasingly fierce, reaching the highest Brahma realm.

又如是等，略為三事。一、水所生事、謂藥草等，由初所槁；二、即水事、由五所涸；三、恒相續住體堅實事，由二所燒。
Moreover, such phenomena are briefly categorized into three types. 1) Things born of water, such as medicinal herbs, etc., withered by the first [category of drying]; 2) Water itself, dried up by the fifth [sun]; 3) Things of continuous existence and solid form, ignited by the second [category of burning].

如是世界皆悉燒已，乃至灰墨及與餘影皆不可得，廣說如經。從此名為器世間已壞。滿足二十中劫。如是壞已，復二十中劫住。
Once the world has been entirely consumed by fire in this way, such that even ashes, soot, and remaining shadows are unattainable, as elaborately described in the scriptures. Consequently, it is recognized as the material world having been destroyed, completing twenty intermediate kalpas. After this destruction, it then remains in this state for another twenty intermediate kalpas.

云何水災？謂過七火災已，於第二靜慮中，有俱生水界起，壞器世間，如水消鹽。此之水界與器世間一時俱沒。如是沒已，復二十中劫住。
What is a water disaster? It is said that after enduring the seven fire disasters, within the second dhyāna, a co-emergent water realm arises, destroying the material world in the way water dissolves salt. This realm of water and the material world vanish at the same time. Following this disappearance, it remains in this state for another twenty intermediate kalpas.

云何風災？謂七水災過已，復七火災；從此無間，於第三靜慮中有俱生風界起，壞器世間，如風乾支節、復能消盡。此之風界與器世間一時俱沒。所以者何？現見有一由風界發，乃令其骨皆悉消盡。從此壞已，復二十中劫住。
What is a wind disaster? It is explained that after the seven water disasters have concluded, another series of seven fire disasters occur; immediately after, within the third dhyāna, a simultaneously arising wind realm emerges, destroying the material world as wind dries branches, also having the capacity to obliterate them. This wind realm and the material world vanish together at the same moment. Why? It is observed that a wind from this realm comes forth, causing all bones to utterly disintegrate. After this destruction, it remains in this condition for another twenty intermediate kalpas.

如是略說世間已壞。
Thus, the destruction of the world has been briefly explained.

云何世間成？謂過如是二十中劫已，一切有情業增上力故，世間復成。爾時最初於虛空中，第三靜慮器世間成。如第三靜慮，第二及初亦復如是。爾時第三災頂有諸有情由壽盡故，業盡故，福盡故，從彼沒已，生第三靜慮。餘一切處，漸次亦爾。復從第二災頂生第二靜慮。餘一切處，應知亦爾。復從第一災頂，有一有情由壽等盡故，從彼沒已，生初靜慮梵世界中，為最大梵。由獨一故、而懷不悅。便有希望：今當云何令餘有情亦來生此。當發心時，諸餘有情由壽等盡故，從第二靜慮沒已，生初靜慮彼同分中。
How does the world form again? It is explained that after twenty intermediate kalpas have passed, due to the enhancing force of all sentient beings' karma, the world once more comes into being. At this initial stage, in emptiness, the material world associated with the third dhyāna forms. As with the third dhyāna, so too do the second and the first gradually form again. At this time, at the pinnacle of the third type of disaster, certain sentient beings, due to their lifespans, karma, and merits being exhausted, from there cease and are reborn in the third dhyāna. The same step-by-step process applies to all other regions. Again, from the pinnacle of the second disaster, beings are born into the second dhyāna. The same understanding applies to all other places. Furthermore, from the zenith of the first disaster, a single being, due to exhaustion of its lifespan and so forth, after ceasing from there, is born into the Brahma world of the first dhyāna, becoming the supreme Brahma. Being alone and feeling dissatisfaction, it harbors a desire: "How now shall I cause other sentient beings to also be born here?" At the moment of this aspiration, other sentient beings, due to their lifespans, karma, and merits being exhausted, after ceasing from the second dhyāna, are born into the first dhyāna in the same shared condition.

如是下三靜慮器及有情世間成已。
Thus, the material and sentient worlds of the lower three dhyanas have been formed.

於虛空中，欲界四天宮殿漸成。當知彼諸虛空宮殿皆如化出。又諸有情，從極淨光天眾同分沒，而來生此諸宮殿中。餘如前說。
In emptiness, the palaces of the four heavenly realms of the desire realm gradually form. It should be recognized that all these palaces in emptiness appear as though miraculously produced. Additionally, sentient beings, upon ceasing from the realm of utmost purity and light among beings of similar condition, are reborn into these various palaces. The rest follows as previously described.

自此以後，有大風輪，量等三千大千世界，從下而起，與彼世界作所依持，為欲安立無有宮殿諸有情類。此大風輪有二種相。謂仰周布及傍側布，由此持水令不散墜。
From this moment forward, a great wind disk emerges, comparable in size to the trichiliocosm, rising from below to serve as a foundation for that world, intended for the stable presence of sentient beings in realms lacking palaces within the desire realm. This great wind disk exhibits two forms: spreading upwards and laterally, thereby holding water in place to prevent it from dispersing and dropping.

次由彼業增上力故，於虛空界金藏雲興。從此降雨，注風輪上。次復起風，鼓水令堅，此即名為金性地輪。上堪水雨之所激注，下為風颷之所衝薄。此地成已，即由彼業增上力故，空中復起諸界藏雲，又從彼雲降種種雨。然其雨水，乃依金性地輪而住。
Subsequently, due to the intensified force of their actions, clouds containing gold arise in the space. Rain then falls from these clouds onto the wind disk. Afterwards, wind stirs again, causing the water to solidify; this is hence known as the golden essence earth disk. Subject to the rain's stimulation from above and the wind's buffeting from below, this ground is formed. Following this formation, due to the intensified force of their actions, clouds of various realms once more arise in the sky, and from these clouds, different kinds of rain fall. However, this rainfall rests upon the golden essence earth disk.

次復風起，鼓水令堅。
Next, the wind stirs again, causing the water to solidify.

即由此風力所引故，諸有清淨第一最勝精妙性者，成蘇迷盧山。
Therefore, driven by the power of this wind, those possessing the purest, foremost, and most exquisite essence coalesce to form Mount Sumeru.

此山成已，四寶為體。所謂金、銀、頗胝、琉璃。若中品性者，成七金山。謂持雙山、毘那矺迦山、馬耳山、善見山、朅達洛迦山、持軸山、尼民達羅山。如是諸山，其峯布列，各由形狀差別為名，繞蘇迷盧次第而住。蘇迷盧量，高八萬踰繕那，廣亦如之，下入水際、量亦復爾。又持雙山，等彼之半。從此次第，餘六金山其量漸減，各等其半。
Upon this mountain’s formation, it is constituted of four jewels: specifically gold, silver, beryl, and lapis lazuli. Those of intermediate essence give rise to seven golden mountains: they are Yugandhara, Īṣādhara, Khadiraka, Sudarśana, Aśvakarṇa, Vinadhara, and Nimindhara. These mountains, with their peaks arrayed, receive their names from the differences in their shapes and are located sequentially around Mount Sumeru. Mount Sumeru measures eighty thousand yojanas in height and the same in width, descending into the waters to an equivalent depth. Yugandhara Mountain equals half of that. Subsequently, the sizes of the remaining six golden mountains decrease progressively, each being half the size of the one before.

若下品性者，於蘇迷盧四邊七金山外，成四大洲及八中洲，并輪圍山。此山輪圍四洲而住，量等尼民達羅之半。
For those of lesser essence, beyond the seven golden mountains surrounding Mount Sumeru on all four sides, the four great continents and eight minor continents are formed, along with the encircling Cakravāḍa Mountain. This encircling mountain resides around the four continents and measures half the size of Nimindhara.

復成非天宮殿，此宮在蘇迷盧下，依水而居。
Moreover, the palaces of the Asuras are formed. These palaces are located beneath Mount Sumeru, residing by the waters.

復成大雪山及無熱池周圍崖岸。
Moreover, the great Snow Mountains and the shores around the cool pools are formed.

次成最下八大那洛迦處，諸大那洛迦，及獨一那洛迦、寒那洛迦、近邊那洛迦。
Subsequently, the lowest eight great Narakas (hell realms) are formed, encompassing the great Narakas, the solitary Naraka, the cold Narakas, and the peripheral Narakas.

復成一分鬼、傍生處。
Furthermore, the realms of hungry ghosts and adjacent births are formed.

四大洲者，謂南贍部洲、東毘提訶洲、西瞿陀尼洲、北拘盧洲。其贍部洲，形如車箱；毘提訶洲，形如半月；瞿陀尼洲，其形圓滿；北拘盧洲，其形四方。贍部洲量，六千五百踰繕那；毘提訶洲量，七千踰繕那；瞿陀尼洲量，七千五百踰繕那；拘盧洲量，八千踰繕那。又七金山，其間有水、具八支德，名為內海。
The four great continents are Jambudvīpa in the south, Pūrvavideha in the east, Aparagodānīya in the west, and Uttarakuru in the north. Jambudvīpa is shaped like a chariot box; Pūrvavideha is shaped like a half-moon; Aparagodānīya is perfectly round; Uttarakuru is square. The size of Jambudvīpa is six thousand five hundred yojanas; Pūrvavideha measures seven thousand yojanas; Aparagodānīya measures seven thousand five hundred yojanas; Uttarakuru measures eight thousand yojanas. Additionally, between the seven golden mountains, there are waters possessing eight virtuous qualities, known as the Inner Ocean.

復成諸龍宮。有八大龍，並經劫住。謂持地龍王、歡喜近喜龍王、馬騾龍王、目支隣陀龍王、意猛龍王、持國龍王、大黑龍王、黳羅葉龍王。是諸龍王，由帝釋力，數與非天共相戰諍。其諸龍眾類有四種。謂卵生、胎生、濕生、化生。妙翅鳥中，四類亦爾。復有餘水，在內海外，故名外海。
Furthermore, the palaces of the Nagas are formed. There are eight great Naga kings, living through the epochs. They are the Earth-Bearing Naga King, the Joyful and Delighting Naga King, the Horse-Mule Naga King, the Mucalinda Naga King, the Fierce-Minded Naga King, the Country-Holding Naga King, the Great Black Naga King, and the Tāmraśāṭīya Naga King. These Naga kings, through the power of Indra, often engage in battles with the Asuras. The various Naga species come in four types: born from eggs, born from wombs, born from moisture, and born from transformation. The wondrous-winged birds are also of these four types. Additionally, there are other waters located outside the Inner Ocean, hence called the Outer Ocean.

又依蘇迷盧根，有四重級。從蘇迷盧初級，傍出一萬六千踰繕那量。即從此量，半半漸減，如其次第，餘級應知。有堅手神住最初級，血手神住第二級，常醉神住第三級，持鬘神住第四級。蘇迷盧頂四隅之上有四大峯，各高五百踰繕那量。有諸藥叉，謂金剛手止住其中。
Furthermore, at the base of Mount Sumeru, there are four levels. From the initial level of Mount Sumeru, it extends out sixteen thousand yojanas. Starting from this distance, it gradually diminishes by half with each subsequent level, and the remaining levels should be understood accordingly. The Solid-Handed deity dwells on the first level, the Blood-Handed deity on the second level, the Perpetually Intoxicated deity on the third level, and the Garland-Bearing deity on the fourth level. At the summit of Mount Sumeru, above its four corners, are four great peaks, each rising to a height of five hundred yojanas. Among these reside various Yakṣas, including those known as the Diamond-Handed, situated within them.

又持雙山，於其四面有四王都。東南西北隨其次第，謂持國、增長、醜目、多聞四大天王之所居止。諸餘金山，是彼四王村邑部落。又近雪山，有大金崖，名非天脅，其量縱廣五十踰繕那，善住龍王常所居鎮，又天帝釋時來遊幸。此中有樹，名曰善住，多羅樹行，七重圍繞。復有大池，名漫陀吉尼，五百小池以為眷屬。善住大龍與五百牝象前後圍繞，遊戲其池，隨欲變現，便入此池，採蓮花根以供所食。即於此側，有無熱大池，其量深廣各五十踰繕那；微細金沙遍布其底，八支德水彌滿其中，形色殊妙，端嚴憙見。從此派流為四大河。一名殑伽，二名信度，三名私多，四名縛芻。
Furthermore, around Yugandhara Mountain, on its four sides, are four royal capitals. In the sequence of southeast, southwest, northwest, and northeast, they are the abodes of the Four Great Heavenly Kings: Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Holder of the Nation), Virūḍhaka (Increaser of Growth), Virūpākṣa (Ugly Eyes), and Vaiśravaṇa (Wide-Eared). The other golden mountains are the villages and tribes of these four kings. Close to the Snow Mountains, there is a great golden cliff called Asura’s Threat, spanning fifty yojanas in height and width, where the Nāga king Vāsuki traditionally dwells and where Lord Śakra (Indra) occasionally visits. In this region, there is a tree named Good Dwelling, surrounded by Pārijāta trees in seven concentric circles. There is also a great pool named Maṇḍākinī, with five hundred smaller pools as its retinue. The Nāga king Vāsuki with five hundred female elephants circles around, playing in this pool, transforming at will, entering the pool to gather lotus roots for food. Beside it, there is the cool great pool, both fifty yojanas in depth and breadth; its bed is covered with fine golden sand, filled with water possessing eight virtuous qualities, its beauty and dignity are remarkable to see. From this pool, four great rivers flow: Gaṅgā, Sītā, Bhadra, and Cchū.

復次，於蘇迷盧頂處中，建立帝釋天宮，縱廣十千踰繕那量。所餘之處，是彼諸天村邑聚落。其山四面，對四大洲，四寶所成。謂對贍部洲，琉璃為面；對毘提訶，白銀為面；對瞿陀尼，黃金為面；對拘盧洲，頗胝為面。又贍部洲，循其邊際，有輪王路，真金所成，如四大王天有情膝量，沒住大海。若輪王出世，如彼膝量海水減焉。又無熱池南有一大樹，名為贍部，是故此洲從彼得名。次於此北、有設拉末梨大樹叢林，四生種類妙翅諸鳥栖集其中。此四大洲各二中洲以為眷屬。復有一洲，羅剎所住。
Furthermore, at the summit of Mount Sumeru, the palace of Lord Śakra (Indra) is established, spanning ten thousand yojanas in width and length. The remaining areas serve as the villages and settlements of those deities. The four sides of the mountain correspond to the four great continents, each made of one of the four jewels. Facing Jambudvīpa is a facade of lapis lazuli; facing Pūrvavideha is one of silver; facing Aparagodānīya is one of gold; and facing Uttarakuru is one of crystal. Additionally, around Jambudvīpa, along its perimeter, there is a Chakravartin's path, made of pure gold, equivalent to the knee height of the beings in the Four Great Kings' heaven, submerged in the great ocean. When a Universal Monarch arises, the sea level decreases to that knee height. South of the cool pool, there is a great tree named Jambu, hence this continent derives its name from it. North of it lies a vast forest of Śālamālī trees, where wondrously-winged birds of four types nest. Each of the four great continents has two subsidiary continents as its dependencies. There is also a continent inhabited by Rākṣasas.

如是器世間成已，有諸有情從極淨光天眾同分沒，來生此中。
After the formation of the material world is complete, various sentient beings, having ceased from the realm of extreme purity and light among beings of similar condition, come to be reborn here.

餘如前說。此皆由彼感劫初業。此業第一，最勝微妙，欲界所攝；唯於此時此業感果，非於餘時。
The rest follows as previously explained. All these are due to the karma associated with the beginning of the kalpa. This karma is foremost, supremely sublime and delicate, encompassed within the desire realm; it is during this period alone that this karma yields its results, not at other times.

爾時有情名劫初者。又彼有色從意所生。如是一切，如經廣說。彼於爾時，未有家宅及諸聚落。一切大地面皆平正。
At that time, sentient beings are called 'beginners of the kalpa.' Furthermore, their physical forms are born of thought. All these, as extensively explained in the scriptures. At that time, there were no houses or settlements. The entire surface of the earth was completely even.

自此以後，由諸有情福業力故，有地味生。如是漸次，地餅、林藤，不種粳稻，自然出現，無糠無𥝖。次有粳稻，有𥝖有糠。次復處處粳稻叢生，於是有情方現攝受。
Following this, by the power of the fortunate karma of sentient beings, the taste of the earth emerges. In a gradual process, cakes of soil and forest creepers, ungrown rice naturally manifests, devoid of husks and chaff. Next, rice with husks and chaff appears. Afterward, rice grows in clusters all around, and at this stage, sentient beings start to gather and consume it.

次由受用味等資緣，有情之類惡色便起，光明遂滅。其多食者惡色逾增，身極沈重。此諸有情互相輕毀，惡法現行。由此因緣，所有味等漸沒於地。如經廣說。復從此緣，諸有情類更相顧眄，便起愛染。次由能感男女業故，一分有情男根生起，一分有情女根生起。遞相陵犯，起諸邪行，遂為他人之所訶呰，方造室宅以自隱蔽。復由攝受粳稻因故，遂於其地復起攝受。
Following this, as they consume flavors and other sustenance, sentient beings begin to exhibit unpleasant appearances, and their luminance fades. Those who eat more see their unattractiveness further increase, and their bodies become exceedingly heavy. These sentient beings then start to disdain each other, and negative actions become evident. Due to these causes, all such flavors gradually vanish into the earth, as detailed in the scriptures. Moreover, from these circumstances, sentient beings start to look upon each other, leading to the emergence of desire. Consequently, influenced by the karma that differentiates genders, some sentient beings begin to develop male characteristics, and others, female characteristics. Engaging in each other, they partake in immoral acts, eventually being ridiculed by others, prompting them to construct homes for concealment. Also, because of the act of gathering rice, they once more engage in its collection from the ground.

由此緣已，更相爭奪，不與取法從此而生。即由此緣立司契者，彼最初王名大等意。如是便有剎帝利眾、婆羅門眾、吠舍眾、戍陀羅眾出現世間。漸次因緣，如經廣說。又彼依止光明既滅，世間便有大黑闇生，日月星宿漸漸而起。其日輪量五十一踰繕那。當知月輪其量減一。日輪以火頗胝所成，月輪以水頗胝所成。此二輪中，月輪行速及與不定。又彼日輪，恒於二洲俱時作明，復於二洲俱時作闇。謂於一日中，於一日出，於一夜半，於一日沒。又一切所有日月星宿，歷蘇迷盧處半而行，與持雙山高下量等。又復日行時有遠近，若遠蘇迷盧，立為寒分；若近蘇迷盧，立為熱分。即由此故，沒有遲速。又此月輪，於上稍欹，便見半月。由彼餘分障其近分，遂令不見。如如漸側，如是如是漸現圓滿；若於黑分如如漸低，如是如是漸現虧減。由大海中有魚鼈等影現月輪，故於其內有黑相現。諸星宿中，其量大者十八拘盧舍量，中者十拘盧舍量，最小者四拘盧舍量。
As a result of these conditions, further conflicts over possessions arose, leading to the practice of not sharing. This led to the appointment of a leader, the first king named Mahāsammata. Thus began the appearance of the Kṣatriyas, Brāhmaṇas, Vaiśyas, and Śūdras in the world. The gradual causes and conditions are as detailed in the scriptures. Moreover, as the brilliance diminished, the world was enveloped in great darkness, leading to the gradual emergence of the sun, moon, and stars. The sun measures fifty-one yojanas across, and it should be noted that the moon's dimensions are one less. The sun is constituted by the fire element, while the moon is of the water element. Within these two orbs, the moon's orbit is faster and erratic. Also, the sun illuminates two continents simultaneously, leaving two in darkness, meaning that within one day there is dawn, daylight, night, and dusk. All celestial bodies, including the sun and moon, traverse half of Mount Sumeru, reaching the height of Yugandhara Mountain. The sun's trajectory varies; being distant from Mount Sumeru marks the cold season, while proximity marks the warm season, thus affecting their visibility. When the moon tilts slightly, a half-moon becomes visible because the other half obstructs visibility. As it tilts further, it appears fully; as it descends into the dark half, it wanes accordingly. The reflection of creatures such as fish and turtles in the great ocean appearing on the moon is why dark spots are visible on it. Among the stars, the largest measure eighteen krośas, the mediums ten krośas, and the smallest four krośas.

復次，於世間四姓生已，方乃發起順愛不愛五趣受業。從此以後，隨一有情由感雜染增上業故，生那洛迦中作靜息王。從此無間，有那洛迦卒，猶如化生，及種種苦具，謂銅鐵等那洛迦火起。然後隨業有情於此受生，及生餘趣。
Additionally, once the four castes have come into existence in the world, then actions conducive to love or aversion towards the five realms of rebirth begin to emerge. From then on, any sentient being, due to the intensifying karma from mixed defilements, is reborn in the Naraka realms as a sovereign of stillness. Continuously, deaths in Naraka seem as spontaneous as their creation, along with a variety of torments, including the arising of fires from materials such as copper and iron. Then, based on their karma, sentient beings are reborn there to endure these torments, as well as in other realms.

如是百拘胝四大洲，百拘胝蘇迷盧，百拘胝六欲天，百拘胝梵世間，三千大千世界俱成俱壞。即此世界有其三種。一、小千界，謂千日月乃至梵世，總攝為一。二、中千界，謂千小千。三、大千界，謂千中千。合此名為三千大千世界。如是四方上下無邊無際三千世界，正壞正成。猶如天雨，注如車軸，無間無斷，其水連注，墮諸方分。如是世界遍諸方分，無邊無際，正壞正成。即此三千大千世界名一佛土。如來於中現成正覺，於無邊世界施作佛事。
Thus, the hundred koṭi four great continents, hundred koṭi Mount Sumerus, hundred koṭi realms of the six desires, and hundred koṭi Brahma worlds, making up the trichiliocosm, jointly come into formation and dissolution. This world comprises three types: 1) The minor thousand world system, consisting of a thousand suns and moons up to the Brahma realms, all encompassed as one. 2) The medium thousand world system, composed of a thousand minor thousand worlds. 3) The major thousand world system, consisting of a thousand medium thousand worlds. Together, these are known as the trichiliocosm. Such is the three thousand worlds in all directions, above and below, limitless and boundless, undergoing constant formation and destruction. Similar to how rain falls uniformly, like water flowing around a wheel’s axle without interruption, falling into all quarters. In this way, the world, extending in all directions, limitless and boundless, continuously forms and dissolves. This trichiliocosm is called a single Buddha field. Within it, the Tathāgata attains supreme enlightenment and performs Buddha activities across infinite worlds.

如是安立世界成已，於中五趣可得，謂那洛迦、傍生、餓鬼、人、天。
Upon thus establishing the completed formation of the world, within it, the five destinations become attainable, namely: Narakas (hells), adjacent births, hungry ghosts, humans, and gods.

及四生可得，謂卵生、胎生、濕生、化生。復有六種依持。
And the four modes of birth are found, namely: born from eggs, born from wombs, born from moisture, and born from transformation.

Furthermore, there are seven types of arrogance.
Furthermore, there are four types of speech.
Furthermore, there are numerous phrases of speech.

云何那落迦趣？謂種果所攝那洛迦諸蘊，及順那洛迦受業。如那洛迦趣如是，傍生、餓鬼、人、天、如其所應盡當知。
What constitutes the Naraka realm? It refers to the aggregates encompassed by the Naraka realms due to the results of their actions, and the karma endured in accordance with Naraka. Just as with the Naraka realm, adjacent births, hungry ghosts, humans, gods, and as befits each, should be fully understood.

云何卵生？謂諸有情破㲉而出。彼復云何？如鵞、雁、孔雀、鸚鵡、舍利鳥等。
What is the Naraka destination? It involves the aggregates of beings in the Naraka realms as encompassed by their resultant actions, and the karma experienced in alignment with Naraka. As with the realm of Naraka, so too are the realms of adjacent births, hungry ghosts, humans, gods, and as per their corresponding conditions, to be thoroughly comprehended.

云何胎生？謂諸有情胎所纏裹，剖胎而出。彼復云何？如象、馬、牛、驢等。
What constitutes womb birth? It is when sentient beings are encased within a womb and are born through the division of the womb. How so? As with elephants, horses, cows, donkeys, and similar creatures.

云何濕生？謂諸有情隨因一種濕氣而生。彼復云何？如蟲、蝎、飛蛾等。
What constitutes moisture birth? It involves sentient beings arising from a specific type of moist air due to certain conditions. How so? As with worms, scorpions, moths, and similar creatures.

云何化生？謂諸有情業增上故，具足六處而生，或復不具。彼復云何？如天、那洛迦全，及人、鬼、傍生一分。
