We're going to translate some Buddhist texts into English. This text is called the "Yogacarabhumi Shastra."

I'll give you the chinese text line-by-line.

First, look for chinese that is transliterated sanskrit. Tell me about any occurances of transliterated sanskrit.

Then, translate the text to english, remaining as literal as possible, and use romanized sanskrit for any text that is transliterated. Write this on a single line with ``` before and after for easy parsing.

You do not need to provide further commentary on the meaning of the text.

Keep your translations consistent, and try to stay consistent with this source text:
