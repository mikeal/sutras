Hello! I am working on translating a Buddhist Sutra from Chinese to English and have already made some progress.Below is the text that has been translated so far, followed by the next line that needs translation.I'm aiming for translations to be as accurate and literal as possible. Additionally, when Sanskrit terms are transliterated into Chinese, I need their Romanized Sanskrit equivalents provided.

Specific translations preferences include:
* "anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi" for "無上正真道最正覺"
  * "BuddhaDharma" for "佛道"
    * "trisāhasra-mahāsāhasra-lokadhātu" for "三千大千世界"

Here's what has been translated up to this point:



Could you provide a detailed breakdown of the new line, including key phrases and terms, and then offer a completed English translation ?

  Thank you for your assistance!
